  <title>Quality Model - Quality Deficit Index</title>

  
</head><body>
<h1>Quality Deficit Index<br>
</h1>

The high-level part of the quality model and its two
operationalizations (i.e. object-oriented and procedural) can be used
in order to compute a global quality
score, called the "Quality Deficit Index" (QDI). The computation
process is bottom-up, and takes into accound the following:<br>

<ul>

  <li>the severity of each individual design flaw instance that is
detected by the tool</li>
  <li>the number of instances of each particular design flaw type</li>
  <li>the relative impact of each particular design flaw type</li>
  <li>the relative proportion of object oriented and procedural code
(for hybrid systems)<br>
  </li>
</ul>

The resulting QDI score is a positive, upwards unbound value, which is
a measure of
"badness" of the analyzed system's design quality. This score is
further normalized to the size of the code base, and thus can be used
in order to track the evolution of the system in time.<br>
