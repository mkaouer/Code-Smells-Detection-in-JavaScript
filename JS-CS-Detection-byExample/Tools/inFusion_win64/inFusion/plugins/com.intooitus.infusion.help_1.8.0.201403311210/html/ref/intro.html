<h1>Welcome to inFusion Hydrogen<br>
</h1>

inFusion a complex and very powerful tool, designed to
analyze, assess, and help you improve the design of large software
systems, written in Java, C++ or C. It detects design flaws
automatically, and helps you
understand the causes of quality problems on the level of code and
design.<br>

Software quality is generally more difficult to achieve
and maintain than quality of physical systems. This is because software
is ... "soft", meaning that it is usually much cheaper and faster to
make a change in a software system, as opposed to a physical system.
Thus, the rate of change is much higher in software than in physical
systems. Also, software is by its nature very complex, and thus prone
to human error, especially when developed collectively in a large team.
This is because team members often have very different programming
skills as well as different degrees of knowledge about the system
itself.<br>

inFusion was designed to help its users improve their
programming skills by pointing out problematic violations of
established design and programming practices and by providing guidance
to solve these problems. The tool also provides the means to explore
and understand the entire context of these problems in order to support
their correction.<br>

      <img style="border: 0px solid ; width: 160px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="images/detection.png" align="left" hspace="10">inFusion
detects 24 design and code anti-patterns (smells) commonly encountered in software projects. Notable examples
include: <a href="df/godclass.html">God Class</a>, <a href="df/dataclass.html">Data Class</a>, <a href="df/significantexternalduplication.html">Code
Duplication</a>, <a href="df/dataclumps.html">Data Clumps</a>, <a href="df/featureenvy.html">Feature Envy</a>, or <a href="df/messagechains.html">Message Chains</a>
(violations of
"Demeter's Law"). These anti-patterns cover all the essential quality
concerns: Complexity, Encapsulation, Coupling, Inheritance, and
Cohesion.<br>

provides three
metrics-based interactive visualizations, which
allow a highly effective exploration of your system's design and its
problems. The <a href="pm/pmap.html">Package Map</a> shows
the distribution of classes in packages/folders; the <a href="pm/imap.html">Inheritance Map</a>
reveals the class hierarchies; and the <a href="pm/cmap.html">Class Map</a>
presents the internal
structure of a class, as well as its interactions with other classes.<br>

features contextual insights and exploration tools that provide
invaluable hints during refactoring. By allowing a detailed exploration
of various metrics and relations, inFusion helps you track down the
particular cause and context of any given problem instance. This in
turn allows you to identify the best suited refactoring to remove the
problem and improve the quality of your code and design.<br>

      <img style="width: 160px; height: 160px;" alt="" src="images/metrics.png" align="left" hspace="10">inFusion is able to
compute more than 50 software metrics, ranging from basic size and

Cohesion (<a href="sm/lcc.html">LCC</a>, <a href="sm/tcc.html">TCC</a>),
or Inheritance (<a href="sm/bovr.html">BOVR</a>, <a href="sm/dit.html">DIT</a>,
      <a href="sm/pnas.html">PNAS</a>). These metrics are used as
indicators in the detection of design flaws, as well as to <a href="ui/pyramid.html">characterize and compare systems</a>. </td>
