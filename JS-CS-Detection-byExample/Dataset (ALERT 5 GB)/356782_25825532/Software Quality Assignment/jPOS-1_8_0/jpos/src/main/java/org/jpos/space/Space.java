/**
 * <p><b>Space</b> uses concepts described in the Linda Coordination Language 
 * that eases the implementation of other jPOS components (such as 
 * Channels, Muxes, etc.), but it is not by any means an attempt to provide
 * a full implementation.</p>
 *
 * <p>jPOS's Space is basically a Map where each entry is a LinkedList 
 * of values that can be used as a BlockingQueue</p>
 *
 * <p>One can place entries on a queue by calling Space.out, take them
 * by calling Space.in and read (without taking) by calling Space.rd</p>
