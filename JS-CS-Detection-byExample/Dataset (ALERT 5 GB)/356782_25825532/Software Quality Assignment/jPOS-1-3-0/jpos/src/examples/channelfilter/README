channelfilter is almost identical to 'simpleclient' (it uses the
same configuracion prefix so you can run against 'simpleserver'
or use it via '-testmux' (see ../simpleserver/README and ../simplemux/README).

It implements ISOFilter and demonstrate its use.

This particular filters sets a private field (60) with 
"Outgoing" or "Incoming" message and Vetoes all 0800 messages.

A note regarding ISOFilter.VetoException: we've decided to extend 
ISOException in order not to break existing code (all calls to
ISOChannel.send() and ISOChannel.receive() currently catches
ISOException, drawback being the fact that you have to catch/rethrow 
VetoExceptions inside Filters (most ISOMsg operations need to catch 
ISOException).
