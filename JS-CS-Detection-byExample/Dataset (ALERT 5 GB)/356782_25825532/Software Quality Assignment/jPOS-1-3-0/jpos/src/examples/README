This directory contains examples that demonstrate the use of jPOS classes. 

In order to run the examples you have to
(from your base jPOS installation directory)

   build examples
   example <example-name> (i.e. example hello)

(add .sh or .bat depending on your OS)

We recommend that you read them in the following order:

   - logger: jPOS extensively uses the logger subsystem.
     You are also welcome to use it outside jPOS in your own 
     applications as well.

   - isomsg: show how to handle ISOMsg manipulation (set/unset
     fields, merge, clone, restricted-clone, nested messages)

   - simplepacking: shows how to pack and unpack an ISOMsg;
     provides instructions on how to extend ISOPackagers
     and ISOFieldPackagers

   - simpleserver: a simple ISOChannel based server,

   - simpleclient: demonstrates connection with simpleserver

   - simplemux: runs between simpleserver and simpleclient
     multiplexing messages

You don't need to deal with GUI stuff in order to setup your
desired interchange but anyway you may try
    
    - simplegui: sends messages to simpleserver with a nice GUI
      
Misc examples:
   
   We use examples source tree to create simple applications used
for demonstration, proof of concept, debugging, test, etc. 
This is the case of:

   - xmlpacking (pack/unpack to/from XML file)
   - xsltfilter (demo XSL Transformations)
   - channelfilter (test ISOChannel's filters [see ISOFilter])
   - isoserver: similar to simpleserver, uses ISOServer component
   - dirpoll: test org.jpos.util.DirPoll functionality
