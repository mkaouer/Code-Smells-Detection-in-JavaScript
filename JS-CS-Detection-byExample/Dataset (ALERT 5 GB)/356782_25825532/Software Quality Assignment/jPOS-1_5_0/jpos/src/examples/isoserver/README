isoserver is similar to simpleserver but uses ISOServer
class instead of handling sessions itself.

It demonstrate the use of ChannelConnectors, Filters 
and LoopbackChannel as well.


-------+     +---------+                 +--------+
Server |<--->|ISOServer|---------------->|Loopback|
Socket |<--->|         |<-\   [Reply]    |Channel |
-------+     +---------+   \--[Filter]---|        |
                                         +--------+

This example is hardcoded for port 8000, ASCIIChannel and ISO87APackager,
this should match src/etc/jpos.cfg's simpleclient config if you are to
test it from simpleclient example.

It may seems confusing the fact that ISOServer receives a 'ServerChannel'
on its client side. Client side channel will implement the protocol required
to talk with remove clients, but it is still a ServerChannel, we are on
the server side of that connection.
