BonkEnc version 0.6

BonkEnc is an encoder for various audio formats. It can
produce MP3, AAC, BONK and Ogg Vorbis files.

BonkEnc uses LAME for MP3 encoding, but it can also use the
BladeEnc encoder (available from http://bladeenc.mp3.no/).
Just copy the BladeEnc DLL to your BonkEnc directory.

You need the FAAC DLL for encoding AAC files. You can get the sources
at http://faac.sf.net/. Use MingW32 to build a DLL from the sources
in the libfaac directory. Contact me if you need help.

Note that BladeEnc uses algorithms that the Fraunhofer IIS claims to
have patents for and therefore may not be used in countries allowing
software patents (in fact I'm not sure if you may use it in countries
not allowing software patents - like most European countries).

The same applies to FAAC, which uses algorithms that the Dolby Labs
claim to have patents for.

BonkEnc uses Albert L. Fabers CDRip DLL for audio ripping.

		- initial release

Requirements
------------

	- Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/SE/ME
	- A 200MHz processor or better for playing BONK files
	- Winamp is required to play BONK files in Windows
	- You need a Winamp plugin in order to play .ogg files.
	  Pick the one called 'Nullsoft Vorbis Decoder' from
	  www.winamp.com - older Plugins will not work.
	- You'll need properly installed ASPI drivers for
	  CD ripping.

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW32 v1.0 or greater (http://mingw.sf.net/)
		- smooth v0.8.58.1 (http://smooth.sf.net/)
		- IOLib v5.x (http://iolib.sf.net/ - included with smooth)

	Additional optional software:

		- BladeEnc is used if installed
		- FAAC is used if installed
		- CDRip is used if installed

Problems
--------

	- The current version of Paul Harrison's BONK encoder still has a few bugs.
	  Please contact him (pfh@csse.monash.edu.au) if BonkEnc generates BONK files with errors.

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BonkEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit
		- BladeEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit at 32, 44.1 or 48kHz
		- LAME:
				- files must be 16 bit at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48kHz)
		- Ogg Vorbis:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- FAAC:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- You'll have to experiment a bit to find good settings for BONK. I prefer the default settings
	  with less quantization and a small predictor.

Future plans
------------

	- extend the BONK format to support ID3V2 tags
	- extract artist and title from the filename and write ID3V2 or similar
	- support CD-Text
	- input filters for MP3, Ogg Vorbis, BONK, AAC
	- support more audio formats (FLAC, VQF, MAC, ...)
	- allow expert settings for LAME (ATH, Temporal Masking, Psy-Models)
	- develop an IOLib-Filters based plugin system
