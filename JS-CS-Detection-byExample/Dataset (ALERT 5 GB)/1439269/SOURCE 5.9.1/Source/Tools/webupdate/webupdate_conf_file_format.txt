webupdate.conf file format description
Written by Michal Molhanec
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is brief description of Dev-C++ WebUpdate webupdate.conf file format. 

The file starts with line:
{WebUpdate_config_file}
which uses WebUpdate to recognize if it's really webupdate.conf file.
Then there are devpak chunks. Each devpak has this entry:

[SectionName]
Name=Some name
Description=This is some devpak.<CR>Another line.
RemoteFilename=xxx.DevPak
LocalFilename=xxx.DevPak
Group=Compression
InstallPath=
Version=5.6.7
Size=9543534
Date=2004-03-02 23:22
Execute=1

Name ............. Name of the devpak which will be used in Dev-C++ 4.9.8.11
                   and higher. Different devpaks can have same name. If this
                   field is not present, SectionName is used as a devpak's
                   name.
SectionName ...... Name of a section, typically created as a combination of
                   Name and Version field. SectionName must be unique, there
                   cannot be two records in webupdate.conf with same
                   SectionName. This field is used in Dev-C++ up to 4.9.8.10
                   as a name of a devpak.
Description ...... Description of the devpak. The <CR> will be interpreted as
                   a new line.
RemoteFilename ... Name of devpak file on a server. It can be relative path
                   (e.g. RemoteFilename=files/bla.DevPak) or complete url
                   (e.g. RemoteFilename=http://www.server.org/bla.DevPak) which
                   starts with http:// and can lead to completely different
                   server.
LocalFilename .... Name under which will be the devpak stored on user's machine.
Group ............ Name of a group the devpak is assigned to.
                   Under Dev-C++ 4.9.8.11 and higher it is possible to enter
                   more groups divided by comma (e.g. Group=Allegro,OpenGL).
InstallPath ...... Path where to install the devpak. For normal devpak this
                   would be empty. There can be some special values:
                   {OriginalPath}, {Config}, {Help}, {Lang}, {Exec} but I have
                   no exact idea what are they for :-). But these macros work
                   only if Execute=0!
Version .......... Optional version description. If you don't know version don't
                   leave this field blank (it won't work), simply omit this
                   field at all (Simply: "Version=" won't work).
Size ............. Optional size in bytes. It really has to be a number, don't
                   put there something like "51 kB", the WebUpdate will do this
                   automatically. In contrast to Version field this can be blank
                   but you can also completely omit it.
Date ............. Date and time in format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM".
Execute .......... Execute=1 means to run PackMan.exe on the devpak after
                   downloading. You have to use this for normal devpaks, if you
                   want them to be installed.

WARNING: for WebUpdate and Packman to cooperate well, Name and Version parameters should
be the exact same strings as the ones used in DevPak's Name and Version fields
(in Packman or PackMaker). DevPak's Name and Version fields are encoded in DevPaks
Devpakage, and may have nothing to do with the Devpak's filename.
