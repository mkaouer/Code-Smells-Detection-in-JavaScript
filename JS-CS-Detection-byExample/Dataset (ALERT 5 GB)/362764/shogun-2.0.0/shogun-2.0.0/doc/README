Build-Dependencies to Generate the Documentation
================================================

The following packages (as in Debian GNU/Linux, your distribution/OS might
differ) have to be installed to build the documentation successfully. Please
report if you have any problems and the list will be extended accordingly:

graphviz ( >= 2.12, as in current unstable)
texlive-extra-utils
texlive-latex-recommended
texlive-lang-french
texlive-latex-extra
gs
doxygen
python-docutils


When you have got all these, a simple

	make

should suffice. Beware, the generation will take a few minutes!

You will find the user and developer documentation in the html directory.
