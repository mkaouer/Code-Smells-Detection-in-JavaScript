Plugins folder
--------------
This folder is where user-written plugins go. It contains
two sample plug-ins. "RedAndBlue_.java" is an example
acquisition plug-in for acquiring or generating images.
"Inverter_.java" is an example image filter. Plugins with
an underscore in their name are automatically installed
in the PlugIns menu. They can be installed in other
menus using the Plugins/Hot Keys/Install Plugin command.
Use the Plugins/Edit or Plugins/Compile and Run commands
to compile and run a plugin.
