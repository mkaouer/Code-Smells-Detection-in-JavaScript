/**
 * This class contains all the stock quotes currently in memory. Its purpose is to
 * cache stock quotes so that tasks do not have to query the database or files whenever they
 * need a quote. While this is a cache it does not control when stock quotes are loaded
 * or freed, that is controlled by {@link QuoteBundleCache}.
 * <p>
 * Tasks should not directly call this class, but should go through a {@link QuoteBundle}.
 * <p>
 * When tasks access quotes in a quote cache, either directly or via a quote bundle they
 * can access quotes in two ways. The first way is specifying the actual date they
 * are interested in, i.e. a {@link TradingDate}. The other way is specifying a fast
 * access date offset. The fast access date offset is used when lots of quotes have
 * to be queried as fast as possible.
 * <p>
 * The latest date in the cache has an offset of 0. The previous trading date
 * (i.e. not a weekend) has offset -1, the previous one to that -2 etc.
 * You can convert to and from fast access dates using {@link #dateToOffset} and
 * {@link #offsetToDate}.
