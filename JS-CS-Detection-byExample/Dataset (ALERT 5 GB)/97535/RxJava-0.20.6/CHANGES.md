RxJava 0.20.0 is a major release that adds "reactive pull" support for backpressure along with several other enhancements leading into the 1.0 release.

#### Reactive Pull for Backpressure

Solutions for backpressure was the major focus of this release. A "reactive pull" implementation was implemented. Documentation on this and other options for backpressure are found in the wiki: https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure

The reactive pull solution evolved out of [several prototypes and interaction with many people over the months](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1000). 

##### Signature Changes

A new type `Producer` has been added:

```java
public interface Producer {
    public void request(long n);
}
```

The `Subscriber` type now has these methods added:

```java
public abstract class Subscriber<T> implements Observer<T>, Subscription {
    public void onStart();
    protected final void request(long n);
    public final void setProducer(Producer producer);
}
```


##### Examples


This trivial example shows requesting values one at a time:

```java
Observable.from(1, 2, 3, 4).subscribe(new Subscriber<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        // on start this tells it to request 1
        // otherwise it defaults to request(Long.MAX_VALUE)
        request(1);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer t) {
        System.out.println(t);
        // as each onNext is consumed, request another 
        // otherwise the Producer will not send more
        request(1);
    }

});
```

The [OnSubscribeFromIterable](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/1.x/rxjava/src/main/java/rx/internal/operators/OnSubscribeFromIterable.java) operator shows how an `Iterable` is consumed with backpressure.

Some hi-lights (modified for simplicity rather than performance and completeness):

```java
public final class OnSubscribeFromIterable<T> implements OnSubscribe<T> {

    @Override
    public void call(final Subscriber<? super T> o) {
        final Iterator<? extends T> it = is.iterator();
		// instead of emitting directly to the Subscriber, it emits a Producer
        o.setProducer(new IterableProducer<T>(o, it));
    }
	
	private static final class IterableProducer<T> implements Producer {
	
        public void request(long n) {
            int _c = requested.getAndAdd(n);
            if (_c == 0) {
                while (it.hasNext()) {
                    if (o.isUnsubscribed()) {
                        return;
                    }
                    T t = it.next();
                    o.onNext(t);
                    if (requested.decrementAndGet() == 0) {
                        // we're done emitting the number requested so return
                        return;
                    }
                }

                o.onCompleted();
            }

        }
	}
}
```

The [`observeOn` operator](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/1.x/rxjava/src/main/java/rx/internal/operators/OperatorObserveOn.java#L85) is a sterotypical example of queuing on one side of a thread and draining on the other, now with backpressure.

```java
private static final class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {
        @Override
        public void onStart() {
            // signal that this is an async operator capable of receiving this many
            request(RxRingBuffer.SIZE);
        }
		
        @Override
        public void onNext(final T t) {
            try {
				// enqueue
                queue.onNext(t);
            } catch (MissingBackpressureException e) {
				// fail if the upstream has not obeyed our backpressure requests
                onError(e);
                return;
            }
			// attempt to schedule draining if needed
            schedule();
        }
		
		// the scheduling polling will then drain the queue and invoke `request(n)` to request more after draining
}
```

Many use cases will be able to use `Observable.from`, `Observable.onBackpressureDrop` and `Observable.onBackpressureBuffer` to achieve "reactive pull backpressure" without manually implementing `Producer` logic. Also, it is optional to make an `Observable` support backpressure. It can remain completely reactive and just push events as it always has. Most uses of RxJava this works just fine. If backpressure is needed then it can be migrated to use a `Producer` or several other approaches to flow control exist such as `throttle`, `sample`, `debounce`, `window`, `buffer`, `onBackpressureBuffer`, and `onBackpressureDrop`.


The [wiki](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/Backpressure) provides further documentation.

##### Relation to Reactive Streams

Contributors to RxJava are involved in defining the [Reactive Streams](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams/) spec. RxJava 1.0 is trying to comply with the semantic rules but is not attempting to comply with the type signatures. It will however have a separate module that acts as a bridge between the RxJava `Observable` and the Reactive Stream types.

The reasons for this are:

- Rx has `Observer.onCompleted` whereas Reactive Streams has `onComplete`. This is a massive breaking change to remove a "d".
- The RxJava `Subscription` is used also a "Closeable"/"Disposable" and it does not work well to make it now also be used for `request(n)`, hence the separate type `Producer` in RxJava. It was attempted to reuse `rx.Subscription` but it couldn't be done without massive breaking changes.
- Reactive Streams uses `onSubscribe(Subscription s)` whereas RxJava injects the `Subscription` as the `Subscriber`. Again, this change could not be done without major breaking changes.
- RxJava 1.0 needs to be backwards compatible with the major Rx contracts established during the 0.x roadmap.

Considering these things, the major semantics of `request(long n)` for backpressure are compatible and this will allow interop with a bridge between the interfaces. 



#### New Features

##### Compose/Transformer

The `compose` operator is similar to `lift` but allows custom operator implementations that are chaining `Observable` operators whereas `lift` is directly implementing the raw `Subscriber` logic.

Here is a trival example demonstrating how using `compose` is a better option than `lift` when existing `Observable` operators can be used to achieve the custom behavior.

```java
import rx.Observable;
import rx.Observable.Operator;
import rx.Observable.Transformer;
import rx.Subscriber;

public class ComposeExample {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Observable.just("hello").compose(appendWorldTransformer()).forEach(System.out::println);
        Observable.just("hello").lift(appendWorldOperator()).forEach(System.out::println);
    }

    // if existing operators can be used, compose with Transformer is ideal
    private static Transformer<? super String, String> appendWorldTransformer() {
        return o -> o.map(s -> s + " world!").finallyDo(() -> {
            System.out.println("  some side-effect");
        });
    }

    // whereas lift is more low level
    private static Operator<? super String, String> appendWorldOperator() {
        return new Operator<String, String>() {

            @Override
            public Subscriber<? super String> call(Subscriber<? super String> child) {
                return new Subscriber<String>(child) {

                    @Override
                    public void onCompleted() {
                        child.onCompleted();
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onError(Throwable e) {
                        child.onError(e);
                    }

                    @Override
                    public void onNext(String t) {
                        child.onNext(t + " world!");
                        System.out.println("  some side-effect");
                    }

                };
            }

        };
    }
}
```

##### retryWhen/repeatWhen

New operators `retryWhen` and `repeatWhen` were added which offer support for more advanced recursion such as retry with exponential backoff.

Here is an example that increases delay between each retry:

```java
Observable.create((Subscriber<? super String> s) -> {
    System.out.println("subscribing");
    s.onError(new RuntimeException("always fails"));
}).retryWhen(attempts -> {
    return attempts.zipWith(Observable.range(1, 3), (n, i) -> i).flatMap(i -> {
        System.out.println("delay retry by " + i + " second(s)");
        return Observable.timer(i, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    });
}).toBlocking().forEach(System.out::println);
```


#### Breaking Changes


The use of `Producer` has been added in such a way that it is optional and additive, but some operators that used to have unbounded queues are now bounded. This means that if a source `Observable` emits faster than the `Observer` can consume them, a `MissingBackpressureException` can be emitted via `onError`.

This semantic change can break existing code.

There are two ways of resolving this:

1) Modify the source `Observable` to use `Producer` and support backpressure.
2) Use newly added operators such as `onBackpressureBuffer` or `onBackpressureDrop` to choose a strategy for the source `Observable` of how to behave when it emits more data than the consuming `Observer` is capable of handling. Use of `onBackpressureBuffer` effectively returns it to having an unbounded buffer and behaving like version 0.19 or earlier.

Example:

```java
sourceObservable.onBackpressureBuffer().subscribe(slowConsumer);
```


#### Deprecations

Various methods, operators or classes have been deprecated and will be removed in 1.0. Primarily they have been done to remove ambiguity, remove nuanced functionality that is easy to use wrong, clear out superfluous methods and eliminate cruft that was added during the 0.x development process but has been replaced.

For example, `Observable.from(T)` was deprecated in favor of `Observable.just(T)` despite being a [painful breaking change](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1563) so as to solve ambiguity with `Observable.from(Iterable)`.

This means that the upgrade from 0.20 to 1.0 will be breaking. This is being done so that the 1.x version can be a long-lived stable API built upon as clean a foundation as possible. 

A stable API for RxJava is important because it is intended to be a foundational library that many projects will depend upon. The deprecations are intended to help this be achieved.

#### Future

The next release will be 1.0 (after a few release candidates). The RxJava project has been split up into many new top-level projects at https://github.com/ReactiveX so each of their release cycles and version strategies can be decoupled. 

The 1.x version is intended to be stable for many years and target Java 6, 7 and 8. The expected outcome is for a 2.x version to target Java 8+ but for RxJava 1.x and 2.x to co-exist and both be living, supported versions.

Further fixes and enhancements bringing us close to completing 0.20.0 and almost ready for 1.0.

A more major change in this release is the deprecation of `Observable.from(T)`. The full discussion can be seen in [#1563](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1563).

Version 0.20.0-RC5 updates `parallel`, `buffer(size)`, `switchOnNext`, `repeat`, and `retry` to support "reactive pull" backpressure. It adds a `groupBy` overload with an element selector, a new `compose` method as an alternative to `lift` for custom operators, fixes bugs and other general improvements.

There are still oustanding items being tracked for 0.20 that need to be completed for the final release.

Version 0.20.0-RC4 continues bug fixes and completing work related to "reactive pull" backpressure. This release updates `amb` and `concat` to connect the backpressure `request`.

Internal uses of `RxRingBuffer` migrated to using `SpmcArrayQueue` which significantly reduces object allocations. See [#1526](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/1526) for details.

The `multicast` operators were updated to use a `Subject` factory so that `Observable` sequences can be reused. See [#1515](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/1515) for details.

### Version 0.20.0-RC2 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.20.0-RC2%22)) ###

Version 0.20.0-RC2 preview release adds support for backpressure to the `zip` operators, fixes bugs and removes the `Subscribe.onSetProducer` method.

This means signature changes are modified to be:

The new type `Producer` ->

```java
public interface Producer {
    public void request(long n);
}
```

New methods added to `Subscriber` ->

```java
public abstract class Subscriber<T> implements Observer<T>, Subscription {
	public void onStart();
	protected final void request(long n);
	public final void setProducer(Producer producer);
}
```

### Version 0.20.0-RC1 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.20.0-RC1%22)) ###


Version 0.20.0-RC1 is a preview release that adds backpressure support to RxJava as per issue [#1000](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1000). It has been done in a way that is mostly additive and most existing code will not be affected by these additions. A section below on "Breaking Changes" will discuss use cases that do break and how to deal with them.

This release has been tested successfully in Netflix production canaries, but that does not exercise all use cases or operators, nor does it leverage the newly added backpressure functionality (though the backpressure code paths are used).


#### Outstanding Work

- The `zip` operator has not yet been upgraded to support backpressure. The work is almost done and it will be included in the next release.
- Not all operators have yet been reviewed for whether they need to be changed in any way. 
- Temporal operators (like `buffer`, `window`, `sample`, etc) need to be modified to disable backpressure upstream (using `request(Long.MAX_VALUE)`) and a decision made about how downstream backpressure requests will be supported.
- Ensure all code works on Android. New data structures rely on `sun.misc.Unsafe` but are conditionally used only when it is available. We need to ensure those conditions are working and the alternative implementations are adequate. The default buffer size of 1024 also needs to be reviewed for whether it is a correct default for all systems, or needs to be modified by environment (such as smaller for Android).
- Ensure use cases needing backpressure all work.

#### Signature Changes

A new type `Producer` has been added:

```java
public interface Producer {
    public void request(long n);
}
```

The `Subscriber` type now has these methods added:

```java
public abstract class Subscriber<T> implements Observer<T>, Subscription {
	public void onStart();
	public final void request(long n);
	public final void setProducer(Producer producer);
	protected Producer onSetProducer(Producer producer);
}
```


#### Examples


This trivial example shows requesting values one at a time:

```java
Observable.from(1, 2, 3, 4).subscribe(new Subscriber<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void onStart() {
        request(1);
    }

    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {
    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {
    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer t) {
        request(1);
    }

});
```

The [OnSubscribeFromIterable](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/master/rxjava-core/src/main/java/rx/internal/operators/OnSubscribeFromIterable.java) operator shows how an `Iterable` is consumed with backpressure.

Some hi-lights (modified for simplicity rather than performance and completeness):

```java
public final class OnSubscribeFromIterable<T> implements OnSubscribe<T> {

    @Override
    public void call(final Subscriber<? super T> o) {
        final Iterator<? extends T> it = is.iterator();
		// instead of emitting directly to the Subscriber, it emits a Producer
        o.setProducer(new IterableProducer<T>(o, it));
    }
	
	private static final class IterableProducer<T> implements Producer {
	
        public void request(long n) {
            int _c = requested.getAndAdd(n);
            if (_c == 0) {
                while (it.hasNext()) {
                    if (o.isUnsubscribed()) {
                        return;
                    }
                    T t = it.next();
                    o.onNext(t);
                    if (requested.decrementAndGet() == 0) {
                        // we're done emitting the number requested so return
                        return;
                    }
                }

                o.onCompleted();
            }

        }
	}
}
```

The [`observeOn` operator](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/master/rxjava-core/src/main/java/rx/internal/operators/OperatorObserveOn.java#L85) is a sterotypical example of queuing on one side of a thread and draining on the other, now with backpressure.

```java
private static final class ObserveOnSubscriber<T> extends Subscriber<T> {
        @Override
        public void onStart() {
            // signal that this is an async operator capable of receiving this many
            request(RxRingBuffer.SIZE);
        }
		
        @Override
        public void onNext(final T t) {
            try {
				// enqueue
                queue.onNext(t);
            } catch (MissingBackpressureException e) {
				// fail if the upstream has not obeyed our backpressure requests
                onError(e);
                return;
            }
			// attempt to schedule draining if needed
            schedule();
        }
		
		// the scheduling polling will then drain the queue and invoke `request(n)` to request more after draining
}
```


#### Breaking Changes

The use of `Producer` has been added in such a way that it is optional and additive, but some operators that used to have unbounded queues are now bounded. This means that if a source `Observable` emits faster than the `Observer` can consume them, a `MissingBackpressureException` can be emitted via `onError`.

This semantic change can break existing code.

There are two ways of resolving this:

1) Modify the source `Observable` to use `Producer` and support backpressure.
2) Use newly added operators such as `onBackpressureBuffer` or `onBackpressureDrop` to choose a strategy for the source `Observable` of how to behave when it emits more data than the consuming `Observer` is capable of handling. Use of `onBackpressureBuffer` effectively returns it to having an unbounded buffer and behaving like version 0.19 or earlier.

Example:

```java
sourceObservable.onBackpressureBuffer().subscribe(slowConsumer);
```

#### Relation to Reactive Streams

Contributors to RxJava are involved in defining the [Reactive Streams](https://github.com/reactive-streams/reactive-streams/) spec. RxJava 1.0 is trying to comply with the semantic rules but is not attempting to comply with the type signatures. It will however have a separate module that acts as a bridge between the RxJava `Observable` and the Reactive Stream types.

The reasons for this are:

- Rx has `Observer.onCompleted` whereas Reactive Streams has `onComplete`. This is a massive breaking change to remove a "d".
- The RxJava `Subscription` is used also a "Closeable"/"Disposable" and it does not work well to make it now also be used for `request(n)`, hence the separate type `Producer` in RxJava. It was attempted to reuse `rx.Subscription` but it couldn't be done without massive breaking changes.
- Reactive Streams uses `onSubscribe(Subscription s)` whereas RxJava injects the `Subscription` as the `Subscriber`. Again, this change could not be done without major breaking changes.
- RxJava 1.0 needs to be backwards compatible with the major Rx contracts established during the 0.x roadmap.
- Reactive Streams is not yet 1.0 and despite significant progress, it is a moving target. 

Considering these things, the major semantics of `request(long n)` for backpressure are compatible and this will allow interop with a bridge between the interfaces. As the Reactive Streams spec matures, RxJava 2.0 may choose to fully adopt the types in the future while RxJava 1.x retains the current signatures.


#### How to Help

First, please test this release against your existing code to help us determine if we have broken anything. 

Second, try to solve backpressure use cases and provide feedback on what works and what doesn't work.

Thank you!

#### Performance and Object Allocation

Fairly significant object allocation improvements are included in this release which reduce GC pressure and improve performance.

Two pull requests (amongst several) with details are:

- https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/1281 Reduce Subscription Object Allocation
- https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/1246 Moved to atomic field updaters

With the following simple test code relative performance has increased as shown below:

```java
Observable<Integer> o = Observable.just(1);
o.map(i -> {
    return String.valueOf(i);
}).map(i -> {
    return Integer.parseInt(i);
}).subscribe(observer);
```

#### Scala Changes

Many missing operators have been added to the RxScala APIs along with fixes and other maturation.


#### toBlockingObservable() -> toBlocking()

The `toBlockingObservable()` method has been deprecated in favor of `toBlocking()` for brevity and fit better with possible future additions such as `toParallel()` without always needing the `Observable` suffix.


#### forEach

`forEach` as added as an alias for `subscribe` to match the Java 8 naming convention.

This means code can now be written as:

```java
Observable.from(1, 2, 3).limit(2).forEach(System.out::println);
```

which is an alias of this:

```java
Observable.from(1, 2, 3).take(2).subscribe(System.out::println);
```

Since `forEach` exists on `BlockingObservable` as well, moving from non-blocking to blocking looks like this:

```java
// non-blocking
Observable.from(1, 2, 3).limit(2).forEach(System.out::println);
// blocking
Observable.from(1, 2, 3).limit(2).toBlocking().forEach(System.out::println);
```


#### Schedulers

Thread caching is restored to `Schedulers.io()` after being lost in v0.18.

A replacement for `ExecutorScheduler` (removed in 0.18) is accessible via `Schedulers.from(Executor e)` that wraps an `Executor` and complies with the Rx contract. 


#### ReplaySubject

All "replay" functionality now exists directly on the `ReplaySubject` rather than in an internal type. This means there are now several different `create` methods with the various overloads of size and time.

### Version 0.18.0 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.18.0%22)) ###

This release takes us a step closer to [1.0](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/1001) by completing some of the remaining work on the roadmap.

##### Scheduler

The first is simplifying the [Scheduler API](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/997). 

The Scheduler API is now simplified to this:

```java
class Scheduler {
    public abstract Worker createWorker(); 
    public int parallelism();
    public long now();

    public abstract static class Worker implements Subscription {
        public abstract Subscription schedule(Action0 action, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit);
        public abstract Subscription schedule(Action0 action);
        public Subscription schedulePeriodically(Action0 action, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit);
        public long now();
    }
}
```

This is a breaking change if you have a custom `Scheduler` implementation or use a `Scheduler` directly. If you only ever pass in a `Scheduler` via the `Schedulers` factory methods, this change does not affect you.

Additionally, the `ExecutionScheduler` was removed because a general threadpool does not meet the requirements of sequential execution for an `Observable`. It was replaced with `rx.schedulers.EventLoopScheduler` which is the new default for `Schedulers.computation()`. It is a pool of event loops.

##### rx.joins

The `rx.joins` package and associated `when`, `and` and `then` operators were moved out of rxjava-core into a new module rxjava-joins. This is done as the rx.joins API was not yet matured and is not going to happen before 1.0. It was determined low priority and not worth blocking a 1.0 release. If the API matures inside the separate module to the point where it makes sense to bring it back into the core it can be done in the 1.x series.

##### Deprecation Cleanup

This releases removes many of the classes and methods that have been deprecated in previous releases. Most of the removed functionality was migrated in previous releases to contrib modules such as rxjava-math, rxjava-async and rxjava-computation-expressions.

A handful of deprecated items still remain but can not yet be removed until all internal operators are finished migrating to using the `lift`/`Subscriber` design changes done in 0.17.0.

### Version 0.17.0 ([Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.netflix.rxjava%22%20AND%20v%3A%220.17.0%22)) ###


Version 0.17.0 contains some significant signature changes that allow us to significantly improve handling of synchronous Observables and simplify Schedulers. Many of the changes have backwards compatible deprecated methods to ease the migration while some are breaking. 

The new signatures related to `Observable` in this release are:

```java
// A new create method takes `OnSubscribe` instead of `OnSubscribeFunc`
public final static <T> Observable<T> create(OnSubscribe<T> f)

// The new OnSubscribe type accepts a Subscriber instead of Observer and does not return a Subscription
public static interface OnSubscribe<T> extends Action1<Subscriber<? super T>>

// Subscriber is an Observer + Subscription
public abstract class Subscriber<T> implements Observer<T>, Subscription

// The main `subscribe` behavior receives a Subscriber instead of Observer
public final Subscription subscribe(Subscriber<? super T> subscriber)

// Subscribing with an Observer however is still appropriate
// and the Observer is automatically converted into a Subscriber
public final Subscription subscribe(Observer<? super T> observer)

// A new 'lift' function allows composing Operator implementations together
public <R> Observable<R> lift(final Operator<? extends R, ? super T> lift)
	
// The `Operator` used with `lift`
public interface Operator<R, T> extends Func1<Subscriber<? super R>, Subscriber<? super T>>

```

Also changed is the `Scheduler` interface which is much simpler:

```java
public abstract class Scheduler {
	public Subscription schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action);
    public Subscription schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit);
	public Subscription schedulePeriodically(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit);
	public final Subscription scheduleRecursive(final Action1<Recurse> action)
	public long now();
	public int degreeOfParallelism();
	
	public static class Inner implements Subscription {
		public abstract void schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit);
		public abstract void schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action);
		public long now();
	}
	
	public static final class Recurse {
		public final void schedule();
		public final void schedule(long delay, TimeUnit unit);
	}
}
```


This release applies many lessons learned over the past year and seeks to streamline the API before we hit 1.0.

As shown in the code above the changes fall into 2 major sections:

##### 1) Lift/Operator/OnSubscribe/Subscriber

Changes that allow unsubscribing from synchronous Observables without needing to add concurrency.

##### 2) Schedulers

Simplification of the `Scheduler` interface and make clearer the concept of "outer" and "inner" Schedulers for recursion.


#### Lift/Operator/OnSubscribe/Subscriber

New types `Subscriber` and `OnSubscribe` along with the new `lift` function have been added. The reasons and benefits are as follows:

##### 1) Synchronous Unsubscribe

RxJava versions up until 0.16.x are unable to unsubscribe from a synchronous Observable such as this:

```java
Observable<Integer> oi = Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Observer<? super Integer> Observer) {
        for (int i = 1; i < 1000000; i++) {
            subscriber.onNext(i);
        }
        subscriber.onCompleted();
    }
});
```

Subscribing to this `Observable` will always emit all 1,000,000 values even if unsubscribed such as via `oi.take(10)`.

Version 0.17.0 fixes this issue by injecting the `Subscription` into the `OnSubscribe` function to allow code like this:

```java
Observable<Integer> oi = Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
        // we now receive a Subscriber instead of Observer
        for (int i = 1; i < 1000000; i++) {
            // the OnSubscribe can now check for isUnsubscribed
            if (subscriber.isUnsubscribed()) {
                return;
            }
            subscriber.onNext(i);
        }
        subscriber.onCompleted();
    }

});
```

Subscribing to this will now correctly only emit 10 `onNext` and unsubscribe:

```java
// subscribe with an Observer
oi.take(10).subscribe(new Observer<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer t) {
        println("Received: " + t);
    }

})
```

Or the new `Subscriber` type can be used and the `Subscriber` itself can `unsubscribe`:

```java
// or subscribe with a Subscriber which supports unsubscribe
oi.subscribe(new Subscriber<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void onCompleted() {

    }

    @Override
    public void onError(Throwable e) {

    }

    @Override
    public void onNext(Integer t) {
        println("Received: " + t);
        if(t >= 10) {
            // a Subscriber can unsubscribe
            this.unsubscribe();
        }
    }

})
```


##### 2) Custom Operator Chaining

Because Java doesn't support extension methods, the only approach to applying custom operators without getting them added to `rx.Observable` is using static methods. This has meant code like this:

```java
MyCustomerOperators.operate(observable.map(...).filter(...).take(5)).map(...).subscribe()
```

In reality we want:

```java
observable.map(...).filter(...).take(5).myCustomOperator().map(...).subscribe()
```

Using the newly added `lift` we can get quite close to this:


```java
observable.map(...).filter(...).take(5).lift(MyCustomOperator.operate()).map(...).subscribe()
```

Here is how the proposed `lift` method looks if all operators were applied with it:

```java
Observable<String> os = OBSERVABLE_OF_INTEGERS.lift(TAKE_5).lift(MAP_INTEGER_TO_STRING);
```

Along with the `lift` function comes a new `Operator` signature:

```java
public interface Operator<R, T> extends Func1<Subscriber<? super R>, Subscriber<? super T>>
```

All operator implementations in the `rx.operators` package will over time be migrated to this new signature. 

NOTE: Operators that have not yet been migrated do not work with synchronous unsubscribe. 


##### 3) Simpler Operator Implementations

The `lift` operator injects the necessary `Observer` and `Subscription` instances (via the new `Subscriber` type) and eliminates (for most use cases) the need for manual subscription management. Because the `Subscription` is available in-scope there are no awkward coding patterns needed for creating a `Subscription`, closing over it and returning and taking into account synchronous vs asynchronous.

For example, the body of `fromIterable` is simply:

```java
public void call(Subscriber<? super T> o) {
    for (T i : is) {
        if (o.isUnsubscribed()) {
            return;
        }
        o.onNext(i);
    }
    o.onCompleted();
}
```

The `take` operator is:

```java
public Subscriber<? super T> call(final Subscriber<? super T> child) {
        final CompositeSubscription parent = new CompositeSubscription();
        if (limit == 0) {
            child.onCompleted();
            parent.unsubscribe();
        }

        child.add(parent);
        return new Subscriber<T>(parent) {

            int count = 0;
            boolean completed = false;

            @Override
            public void onCompleted() {
                if (!completed) {
                    child.onCompleted();
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void onError(Throwable e) {
                if (!completed) {
                    child.onError(e);
                }
            }

            @Override
            public void onNext(T i) {
                if (!isUnsubscribed()) {
                    child.onNext(i);
                    if (++count >= limit) {
                        completed = true;
                        child.onCompleted();
                        unsubscribe();
                    }
                }
            }

        };
    }
```


##### 4) Recursion/Loop Performance with Unsubscribe

The `fromIterable` use case is 20x faster when implemented as a loop instead of recursive scheduler (see https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/commit/a18b8c1a572b7b9509b7a7fe1a5075ce93657771).

Several places we can remove recursive scheduling used originally for unsubscribe support and use a loop instead.





#### Schedulers


Schedulers were greatly simplified to a design based around `Action1<Inner>`. 

```java
public abstract class Scheduler {
	public Subscription schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action);
    public Subscription schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit);
	public Subscription schedulePeriodically(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action, long initialDelay, long period, TimeUnit unit);
	public final Subscription scheduleRecursive(final Action1<Recurse> action)
	public long now();
	public int degreeOfParallelism();
	
	public static class Inner implements Subscription {
		public abstract void schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action, long delayTime, TimeUnit unit);
		public abstract void schedule(Action1<Scheduler.Inner> action);
		public long now();
	}
	
	public static final class Recurse {
		public final void schedule();
		public final void schedule(long delay, TimeUnit unit);
	}
}
```

This design change originated from three findings:

1) It was very easy to cause memory leaks or inadvertent parallel execution since the distinction between outer and inner scheduling was not obvious.

To solve this the new design explicitly has the outer `Scheduler` and then `Scheduler.Inner` for recursion.

2) The passing of state is not useful since scheduling over network boundaries with this model does not work.

In this new design all state passing signatures have been removed. This was determined while implementing a `RemoteScheduler` that attempted to use `observeOn` to transition execution from one machine to another. This does not work because of the requirement for serializing/deserializing the state of the entire execution stack. Migration of work over the network has been bound to be better suited to explicit boundaries established by Subjects. Thus, the complications within the Schedulers are unnecessary.

3) The number of overloads with different ways of doing the same things were confusing.

This new design removes all but the essential and simplest methods.

4) A scheduled task could not do work in a loop and easily be unsubscribed which generally meant less efficient recursive scheduling. 

This new design applies similar principles as done with `lift`/`create`/`OnSubscribe`/`Subscriber` and injects the `Subscription` via the `Inner` interface so a running task can check `isUnsubscribed()`.



WIth this new design, the simplest execution of a single task is:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        doWork();
    }

});
```

Recursion is easily invoked like this:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().scheduleRecursive(new Action1<Recurse>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Recurse recurse) {
        doWork();
        // recurse until unsubscribed (the schedule will do nothing if unsubscribed)
        recurse.schedule();
    }


});
```

or like this if the outer and inner actions need different behavior:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        doWork();
        // recurse until unsubscribed (the schedule will do nothing if unsubscribed)
        inner.schedule(this);
    }

});
```

The use of `Action1<Inner>` on both the outer and inner levels makes it so recursion that refer to `this` and it works easily. 


Similar to the new `lift`/`create` pattern with `Subscriber` the `Inner` is also a `Subscription` so it allows efficient loops with `unsubscribe` support:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        while(!inner.isUnsubscribed()) {
            doWork();
        }
    }

});
```

An action can now `unsubscribe`	the `Scheduler.Inner`:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        while(!inner.isUnsubscribed()) {
            int i = doOtherWork();
            if(i > 100) {
                // an Action can cause the Scheduler to unsubscribe and stop
                inner.unsubscribe();
            }
        }
    }

});
```

Typically just stopping is sufficient:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        int i = doOtherWork();
        if (i < 10) {
            // recurse until done 10
            inner.schedule(this);
        }
    }

});
```

but if other work in other tasks is being done and you want to unsubscribe conditionally you could:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        int i = doOtherWork();
        if (i < 10) {
            // recurse until done 10
            inner.schedule(this);
        } else {
            inner.unsubscribe();
        }
    }

});
```

and the recursion can be delayed:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        doWork();
        // recurse until unsubscribed ... but delay the recursion
        inner.schedule(this, 500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }

});
```

The same pattern works with the `Recurse` signature:

```java
Schedulers.newThread().scheduleRecursive(new Action1<Recurse>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Recurse recurse) {
        doWork();
        // recurse until unsubscribed (the schedule will do nothing if unsubscribed)
        recurse.schedule(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
    }


});
```

The methods on the `Inner` never return a `Subscription` because they are always a single thread/event-loop/actor/etc and controlled by the `Subscription` returned by the initial `Scheduler.schedule` method. This is part of clarifying the contract.

Thus an `unsubscribe` controlled from the outside would be done like this:

```java
Subscription s = Schedulers.newThread().schedule(new Action1<Inner>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Inner inner) {
        while(!inner.isUnsubscribed()) {
            doWork();
        }
    }

});

// unsubscribe from outside
s.unsubscribe();
```



#### Migration Path

##### 1) Lift/OnSubscribe/Subscriber

The `lift` function will not be used by most and is additive so will not affect backwards compatibility. The `Subscriber` type is also additive and for most use cases does not need to be used directly, the `Observer` interface can continue being used.

The previous `create(OnSubscribeFunc f)` signature has been deprecated so code will work but now have warnings. Please begin migrating code as this will be deleted prior to the 1.0 release.

Code such as this:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribeFunc<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public Subscription onSubscribe(Observer<? super Integer> o) {
        o.onNext(1);
        o.onCompleted();
        return Subscriptions.empty();
    }
});
```

should change to this:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
        subscriber.onNext(1);
        subscriber.onCompleted();
    }
});
```

If concurrency was being injected to allow unsubscribe support:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribeFunc<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public Subscription onSubscribe(final Observer<? super Integer> o) {
        final BooleanSubscription s = new BooleanSubscription();
        Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {

            @Override
            public void run() {
                int i = 0;
                while (!s.isUnsubscribed()) {
                    o.onNext(i++);
                }
            }

        });
        t.start();
        return s;
    }
});
```

you may no longer need it and can implement like this instead:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
        int i = 0;
        while (!subscriber.isUnsubscribed()) {
            subscriber.onNext(i++);
        }
    }
});
```

or if the concurreny is still desired you can simplify the `Subscription` management:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void call(final Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
        Thread t = new Thread(new Runnable() {

            @Override
            public void run() {
                int i = 0;
                while (!subscriber.isUnsubscribed()) {
                    subscriber.onNext(i++);
                }
            }

        });
        t.start();
    }
});
```

or use `subscribeOn` which now works to make synchronous `Observables` async while supporting `unsubscribe` (this didn't work before):

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribe<Integer>() {

    @Override
    public void call(Subscriber<? super Integer> subscriber) {
        int i = 0;
        while (!subscriber.isUnsubscribed()) {
            subscriber.onNext(i++);
        }
    }
}).subscribeOn(Schedulers.newThread());
```



##### 2) Schedulers

Custom `Scheduler` implementations will need to be re-implemented and any direct use of the `Scheduler` interface will also need to be updated.


##### 3) Subscription

If you have custom `Subscription` implementations you will see they now need an `isUnsubscribed()` method.

You can either add this method, or wrap your function using `Subscriptions.create` and it will handle the `isUnsubscribed` behavior and execute your function when `unsubscribe()` is called.

It is recommended to use `Subscriptions.create` for most `Subscription` usage.



#### The Future...

We have most if not all operators from Rx.Net that we want or intend to port. We think we have got the `create`/`subscribe` signatures as we want and the `Subscription` and `Scheduler` interfaces are now clean. There is at least one more major topic related to back pressure that may result in signature change in a future release. Beyond that no further major signature changing work is expected prior to 1.0.

We still need to improve on some of the `Subject` implementations still, particularly `ReplaySubject`. We are beginning to focus after this release on cleaning up all of the operator implementations, stabilizing, fixing bugs and performance tuning.

As we get closer to 1.0 there will be a release that focused on deleting all deprecated methods so it is suggested to start migrating off of them.

We appreciate your usage, feedback and contributions and hope the library is creating value for you!

This is a significant release with the following changes:

- Refactor of Subjects and Subscriptions to non-blocking implementations 
- Many bug fixes, new operators and behavior changes to match Rx.Net. 
- Deprecation of some operators due to renaming or eliminating duplicates 
- The `rx.concurrency` package has been renamed to `rx.schedulers`. Existing classes still remain in `rx.concurrency` but are deprecated. Use of `rx.concurrency` should be migrated to `rx.schedulers` as these deprecated classes will be removed in a future release. 
- Breaking changes to Scala bindings. See [Release Notes](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/blob/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-scala/ReleaseNotes.md) for details.
- New modules: rxjava-string, rxjava-async-util and rxjava-computation-expressions for operators deemed not applicable to the core library.

This release contains a refactor of the Scala Bindings by @headinthebox that results in some breaking changes. 
The previous solution ended up not working well in all cases for idiomatic Scala usage. Java/Scala interop has been changed and is no longer transparent so as to optimize for native Scala usage.
Read the [rxjava-scala README](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-scala) for more information.

This has a very slight breaking change by removing one `doOnEach` overload. The version was not bumped from 0.14 to 0.15 as it is so minor and the offending method was just released in the previous version.

Further progress to the Scala adaptor and a handful of new operators.

Bump to 0.14.0 due to small breaking change to `distinct` operator removing overloaded methods with `Comparator`. These methods were added in 0.13.2 and determined to be incorrect.

This release also includes a new contrib module, [rxjava-apache-http](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/master/rxjava-contrib/rxjava-apache-http) that provides an Observable API to the Apache HttpAsyncClient.

This version adds to the static typing changes in 0.11 and adds covariant/contravariant typing via super/extends generics.

Additional cleanup was done, particularly related to `BlockingObservable`. Also the `window` operator was added.

The largest breaking change is that `Observable.create` now accepts an `OnSubscribeFunc` rather than a `Func1`.

This means that instead of this:

```java
public static <T> Observable<T> create(Func1<? super Observer<? super T>, ? extends Subscription> func)
```

it is now:

```java
public static <T> Observable<T> create(OnSubscribeFunc<T> func)
```

This was done to simplify the usage of `Observable.create` which was already verbose but made far worse by the `? super` generics.

For example, instead of writing this:

```java
Observable.create(new Func1<Observer<? super SomeType>, Subscription>() {
   /// body here
}
```

it is now written as:

```java
Observable.create(new OnSubscribeFunc<SomeType>() {
   /// body here
}
```

This is a major refactor of rxjava-core and the language adaptors. 

Note that there are *breaking changes* in this release. Details are below.

After this refactor it is expected that the API will settle down and allow us to stabilize towards a 1.0 release.

* [Pull 332](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/332) Refactor Core to be Statically Typed

RxJava was written from the beginning to target the JVM, not any specific language.

As a side-effect of Java not having lambdas/clojures yet (and other considerations), Netflix used dynamic languages with it predominantly for the year of its existence prior to open sourcing.

To bridge the rxjava-core written in Java with the various languages a FunctionalLanguageAdaptor was registered at runtime for each language of interest.

To enable these language adaptors methods are overloaded with `Object` in the API since `Object` is the only super-type that works across all languages for their various implementations of lambdas and closures.

This downside of this has been that it breaks static typing for Java, Scala and other statically-typed languages. More can be read on this issue and discussion of the subject here: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rxjava/bVZoKSsb1-o

This release:

- removes all `Object` overload methods from rxjava-core so it is statically typed
- removes dynamic FunctionalLanguageAdaptors 
- uses idiomatic approaches for each language adaptor 
  - Java core is statically typed and has no knowledge of other languages
  - Scala uses implicits
  - Groovy uses an ExtensionModule
  - Clojure adds a new macro ([NOTE: this requires code changes](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/tree/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-clojure#basic-usage))
  - JRuby has been temporarily disabled (discussing new implementation at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/320)
- language supports continue to be additive
  - the rxjava-core will always be required and then whichever language modules are desired such as rxjava-scala, rxjava-clojure, rxjava-groovy are added to the classpath
- deletes deprecated methods
- deletes redundant static methods on `Observable` that cluttered the API and in some cases caused dynamic languages trouble choosing which method to invoke
- deletes redundant methods on `Scheduler` that gave dynamic languages a hard time choosing which method to invoke

The benefits of this are:

1) Everything is statically typed so compile-time checks for Java, Scala, etc work correctly
2) Method dispatch is now done via native Java bytecode using types rather than going via `Object` which then has to do a lookup in a map. Memoization helped with the performance but each method invocation still required looking in a map for the correct adaptor. With this approach the appropriate methods will be compiled into the `rx.Observable` class to correctly invoke the right adaptor without lookups. 
3) Interaction from each language should work as expected idiomatically for that language.

Further history on the various discussions and different attempts at solutions can be seen at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/304, https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/204 and https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/208

This release includes a breaking change as it changes `onError(Exception)` to `onError(Throwable)`. This decision was made via discussion at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/296.

Any statically-typed `Observer` implementations with `onError(Exception)` will need to be updated to `onError(Throwable)` when moving to this version.

This release includes breaking changes that move all blocking operators (such as `single`, `last`, `forEach`) to `BlockingObservable`.

This means `Observable` has only non-blocking operators on it. The blocking operators can now be accessed via `.toBlockingObservable()` or `BlockingObservable.from(observable)`.

Notes and link to the discussion of this change can be found at https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/272.

This is a breaking (non-backwards compatible) release that updates the Scheduler implementation released in 0.7.0.

See https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/19 for background, discussion and status of Schedulers.

It is believed that the public signatures of Scheduler and related objects is now stabilized but ongoing feedback and review by the community could still result in changes.

This release adds the foundations of Rx Schedulers.

There are still open questions, portions not implemented and assuredly bugs and behavior we didn't understand and thus implemented wrong.

Please provide bug reports, pull requests or feedback to help us on the road to version 1.0 and get schedulers implemented correctly.

See https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/19#issuecomment-15979582 for some known open questions that we could use help answering.

*NOTE:* This is a version bump from 0.5 to 0.6 because [Issue 173](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/173) and [Pull 184](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/pull/184) include breaking changes.

These changes are being done in the goal of matching the [Rx.Net](https://rx.codeplex.com) implementation so breaking changes will be made prior to 1.0 on 0.x releases if necessary.

It was found that the `last()` operator was implemented [incorrectly](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/57) (non-blocking instead of blocking) so any use of `last()` on version 0.5.x should be changed to use `takeLast(1)`. Since the return type needed to change this could not be done via a deprecation.

Also [removed](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/issues/173) were the `Observable.createSubscription`/`Observable.noOpSubscription` methods which are now on the rx.subscriptions.Subscriptions utility class as `Subscriptions.create`/`Subscriptions.empty`. These methods could have been deprecated rather than removed but since another breaking change was being done they were just cleanly changed as part of the pre-1.0 process.
