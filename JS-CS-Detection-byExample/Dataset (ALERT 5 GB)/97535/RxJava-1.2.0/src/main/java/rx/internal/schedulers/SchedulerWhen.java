/**
 * Allows the use of operators for controlling the timing around when actions
 * scheduled on workers are actually done. This makes it possible to layer
 * additional behavior on this {@link Scheduler}. The only parameter is a
 * function that flattens an {@link Observable} of {@link Observable} of
 * {@link Completable}s into just one {@link Completable}. There must be a chain
 * of operators connecting the returned value to the source {@link Observable}
 * otherwise any work scheduled on the returned {@link Scheduler} will not be
 * executed.
 * <p>
 * When {@link Scheduler#createWorker()} is invoked a {@link Observable} of
 * {@link Completable}s is onNext'd to the combinator to be flattened. If the
 * inner {@link Observable} is not immediately subscribed to an calls to
 * {@link Worker#schedule} are buffered. Once the {@link Observable} is
 * subscribed to actions are then onNext'd as {@link Completable}s.
 * <p>
 * Finally the actions scheduled on the parent {@link Scheduler} when the inner
 * most {@link Completable}s are subscribed to.
 * <p>
 * When the {@link rx.Scheduler.Worker} is unsubscribed the {@link Completable} emits an
 * onComplete and triggers any behavior in the flattening operator. The
 * {@link Observable} and all {@link Completable}s give to the flattening
 * function never onError.
 * <p>
 * Limit the amount concurrency two at a time without creating a new fix size
 * thread pool:
 *
 * <pre>
 * Scheduler limitScheduler = Schedulers.computation().when(workers -> {
 * 	// use merge max concurrent to limit the number of concurrent
 * 	// callbacks two at a time
 * 	return Completable.merge(Observable.merge(workers), 2);
 * });
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * This is a slightly different way to limit the concurrency but it has some
 * interesting benefits and drawbacks to the method above. It works by limited
 * the number of concurrent {@link rx.Scheduler.Worker}s rather than individual actions.
 * Generally each {@link Observable} uses its own {@link rx.Scheduler.Worker}. This means
 * that this will essentially limit the number of concurrent subscribes. The
 * danger comes from using operators like
 * {@link Observable#zip(Observable, Observable, rx.functions.Func2)} where
 * subscribing to the first {@link Observable} could deadlock the subscription
 * to the second.
 *
 * <pre>
 * Scheduler limitScheduler = Schedulers.computation().when(workers -> {
 * 	// use merge max concurrent to limit the number of concurrent
 * 	// Observables two at a time
 * 	return Completable.merge(Observable.merge(workers, 2));
 * });
 * </pre>
 *
 * Slowing down the rate to no more than than 1 a second. This suffers from the
 * same problem as the one above I could find an {@link Observable} operator
 * that limits the rate without dropping the values (aka leaky bucket
 * algorithm).
 *
 * <pre>
 * Scheduler slowScheduler = Schedulers.computation().when(workers -> {
 * 	// use concatenate to make each worker happen one at a time.
 * 	return Completable.concat(workers.map(actions -> {
 * 		// delay the starting of the next worker by 1 second.
 * 		return Completable.merge(actions.delaySubscription(1, TimeUnit.SECONDS));
 * 	}));
 * });
 * </pre>
