# This file contains special handlings that must be done on
# crowdin strings. For example, some sentences must get a
# ignore-typo flag so that lint does not give a false
# positive.
#
# All the fixes should be idempotent so that this script can be applied
# to the fixed version as well.

# Fix a lint confusion between Portuguese word "com" and "geocaching.com"
# name, which can be flagged as a repetition of the same word.
