make sure code is up to date and everything is in svn:

ant -f bin/build.xml delete
svn update
svn status

run version update script at the top level:

./etc/update_version.sh <version>

    tasks implemented by script:
    update pmd.bat, designer.bat, bgastviewer.*, cygwin-run.sh, cpd.jnlp, cpdgui.bat, build.xml to point to pmd-<version>.jar
    update PMD.java, xdocs/running.xml, compiling.xml, integrations.xml, installing.xml to reflect pmd-<version>
    update the release date in the changelog
    update release number and tag name in project.xml

then, run the script that will generate the proper rulesets/rulesets.properties

./etc/updating_rulesets.sh
	update rulesets/rulesets.properties - add any new ruleset file names

ensure all the new rules are listed in a rulesets/releases/<version>.xml file

ant -f bin/build.xml pmdOnPmd

ant -f bin/build.xml clean regress test
Check in everything

ant -f bin/build.xml  dist regress regress14
Do all the JUnit tests run?  OK, then:

TESTS: Can you
1) run 1 file and get a report
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java xml unusedcode
./bin/pmd.sh ~/tmp/Test.java html rulesets/unusedcode.xml
2) run the Ant 'pmd' task and get a report
ant -f bin/build.xml pmd

run "./generate_release.sh <version>" in etc

It will run:

	ant dist
	./docs.sh all

	generate the binary zip file

	svn tag if "yes" is pressed

	generate the source zip file

if you see a bug and fix it, you can delete the release using:
svn delete https://pmd.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pmd/tags/pmd/pmd_release_<version>
and then retag it

ncftpput upload.sourceforge.net incoming/ pmd-src-<version>.zip pmd-bin-<version>.zip

lftp -e "mput -O incoming/ pmd-src-<version>.zip pmd-bin-<version>.zip" upload.sourceforge.net


Go to Admin, File Releases, Add release
Paste stuff into the changelog/readme boxes
Add the pmd-bin-<version>.zip file
Add the pmd-src-<version>.zip file
Classify the file
Click File Releases, Edit Release, set previous version to 'hidden'.

upload command below will create and upload the maven artifacts to sourceforge. Login info
for 'pmd-repo' must be defined in ~/.m2/settings.xml

cd ~/pmd/pmd/
update the "download" and "what's new" link in navigation.xml
./docs.sh all
