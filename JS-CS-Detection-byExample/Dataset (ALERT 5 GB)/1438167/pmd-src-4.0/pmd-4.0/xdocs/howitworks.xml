<p>
PMD checks source code against rules and produces a report.  Like this:
<ul>
<li>Something passes a file name and a RuleSet into PMD</li>
<li>PMD hands an InputStream to the file off to a JavaCC-generated parser</li>
<li>PMD gets a reference to an Abstract Syntax Tree back from the parser</li>
<li>PMD hands the AST off to the symbol table layer which builds scopes, finds declarations, and find usages.</li>
<li>If any rules need data flow analysis, PMD hands the AST over to the DFA layer for building control flow graphs and data flow nodes.</li>
<li>Each Rule in the RuleSet gets to traverse the AST and check for problems.  The rules can also poke around the symbol table and DFA nodes.</li>
<li>The Report is now filled with RuleViolations, and those get printed out in XML or HTML or whatever</li>
</ul>

<p>Not much detail here... if you think this document can be
improved, please post <a href="http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=188192">here</a> and let me know how.  Thanks!
