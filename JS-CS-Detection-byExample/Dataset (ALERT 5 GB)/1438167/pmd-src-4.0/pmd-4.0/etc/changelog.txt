Fixed a bug in ImportFromSamePackage; now it catches the case where a class has an on-demand import for the same package it is in.
Fixed a bug in CompareObjectsWithEquals; now it catches some local variable cases.
Fixed a bug in CouplingBetweenObjects; it no longer triggers an exception (which is a bug in the symbol table layer) by calling getEnclosingClassScope() when the node in question isn't enclosed by one.
Moved AvoidCallingFinalize from the design ruleset to the finalize ruleset and then deleted redundant ExplicitCallToFinalize rule from the finalize ruleset.

Moved BooleanInstantiation from the design ruleset to the basic ruleset.

October 19, 2004 - 2.0:
New rules: InstantiationToGetClass, IdempotentOperationsRule, SuspiciousEqualsMethodName, SimpleDateFormatNeedsLocale, JUnitTestsShouldContainAssertsRule, SuspiciousConstantFieldName, ImmutableFieldRule, MoreThanOneLoggerRule, LoggerIsNotStaticFinalRule, UseLocaleWithCaseConversions
Applied patch in RFE 992576 - Enhancements to VariableNamingConventionsRule
Implemented RFE 995910 - The HTML report can now include links to HTMLlized source code - for example, the HTML generated by JXR.
Implemented RFE 665824 - PMD now ignores rule violations in lines containing the string 'NOPMD'.

Applied patch 1032927 - The XML report now includes the rule priority.
Added data flow analysis facade from Raik Schroeder.
Added two new optional attributes to rule definitions - symboltable and dfa.  These allow the symbol table and DFA facades to be configured on a rule-by-rule basis.  Note that if your rule needs the symbol table; you'll need to add symboltable="true" to your rule definition.  FWIW, this also results in about a 5% speedup for rules that don't need either layer.
Added a "logging" ruleset - thanks to Miguel Griffa for the code!
Enhanced the ASTViewer - and renamed it 'Designer' - to display data flows.
Moved development environment to Maven 1.0.
Moved development environment to Ant 1.6.2.  This is nice because using the new JUnit task attribute "forkmode='perBatch'" cuts test runtime from 90 seconds to 7 seconds.  Sweet.

Moved LooseCoupling from design.xml to coupling.xml.
Some minor performance optimizations - removed some unnecessary casts from the grammar, simplified some XPath rules.
Postfix expressions (i.e., x++) are now available in the grammar.  To access them, search for StatementExpressions with an image of "++" or "--" - i.e., in XPath, //StatementExpression[@Image="++"].  This is an odd hack and hopefully will get cleared up later.
Ant task and CLI now used BufferedInputStreams.
Converted AtLeastOneConstructor rule from Java code to XPath.
Implemented RFE 743460: The XML report now contains the ruleset name.
Implemented RFE 958714: Private field and local variables that are assigned but not used are now flagged as unused.
