# RxJava: Reactive Extensions for the JVM

RxJava is a Java VM implementation of [Reactive Extensions](http://reactivex.io): a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

It extends the [observer pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) to support sequences of data/events and adds operators that allow you to compose sequences together declaratively while abstracting away concerns about things like low-level threading, synchronization, thread-safety and concurrent data structures.

- Zero Dependencies
- < 800KB Jar
- Java 6+ & [Android](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid) 2.3+
- Java 8 lambda support
- Polyglot ([Scala](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxScala), [Groovy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxGroovy), [Clojure](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxClojure) and [Kotlin](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxKotlin))
- Non-opinionated about source of concurrency (threads, pools, event loops, fibers, actors, etc)
- Async or synchronous execution
- Virtual time and schedulers for parameterized concurrency

## Versioning

Version 1.x is now a stable API and will be supported for several years.

Minor 1.x increments (such as 1.1, 1.2, etc) will occur when non-trivial new functionality is added or significant enhancements or bug fixes occur that may have behavioral changes that may affect some edge cases (such as dependence on behavior resulting from a bug). An example of an enhancement that would classify as this is adding reactive pull backpressure support to an operator that previously did not support it. This should be backwards compatible but does behave differently.

Patch 1.x.y increments (such as 1.0.0 -> 1.0.1, 1.3.1 -> 1.3.2, etc) will occur for bug fixes and trivial functionality (like adding a method overload). New functionality marked with an [`@Beta`][beta source link] or [`@Experimental`][experimental source link] annotation can also be added in patch releases to allow rapid exploration and iteration of unstable new functionality. 

#### @Beta

APIs marked with the [`@Beta`][beta source link] annotation at the class or method level are subject to change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed in any major or minor release but not in a patch release. If your code is a library itself (i.e. it is used on the CLASSPATH of users outside your own control), you should not use beta APIs, unless you repackage them (e.g. using ProGuard, shading, etc).

#### @Experimental

APIs marked with the [`@Experimental`][experimental source link] annotation at the class or method level will almost certainly change. They can be modified in any way, or even removed in any major, minor or, patch release. You should not use or rely on them in any production code. They are purely to allow broad testing and feedback. 

#### @Deprecated

APIs marked with the `@Deprecated` annotation at the class or method level will remain supported until the next major release but it is recommended to stop using them. APIs marked with `@Beta` and `@Experimental` will be marked as deprecated for at least one minor release before they removed in a minor or patch release respectively.

#### rx.internal.*

All code inside the `rx.internal.*` packages is considered private API and should not be relied upon at all. It can change at any time.
