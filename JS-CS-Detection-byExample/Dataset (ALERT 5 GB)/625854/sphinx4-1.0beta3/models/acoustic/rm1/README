The directories here contain various models trained from
the RM1 data

Features used to train the models were computed from
broadband 16 bit sampled data sampled at 16Khz.
The features were 13 dimensional cepstra computed
from 40 mel filters covering the frequency range
130Hz to 6800Hz.
The feature type used was 1s_c_d_dd


Contents of this directory:

dict/
----

etc/
----

Contains the various associated files, such as the mdef file, and a
stripped down version of the variable settings used to train the
models.
