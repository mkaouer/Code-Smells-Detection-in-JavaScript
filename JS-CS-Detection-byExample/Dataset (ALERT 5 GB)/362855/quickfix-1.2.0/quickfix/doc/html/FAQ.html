  <U><B>When trying to connect to a FIX engine running on another machine, QuickFIX immediately drops the connection when it receives a logon</B></U><br>
  Chances are the clocks on the machines are not synchronized. Either synchronize the clocks
  or use the CheckLatency and MaxLatency settings to allow the processing of older messages.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>Why does my IDE mysteriously dissapear when I browse the QuickFIX in MSDEV?</B></U><br>
  Microsoft Visual Studio's Statement completion options do not play very well with C++ templates.
  You can resolve this issues simply by turning this feature off. Do this by going to the
  <B>Tools->Options</B> menu. Under the <B>Editor</B> tab, uncheck all the <B>Statement completion
  options</B>.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>When building QuickFIX with gcc, the compiler complains it cannot find &lt;sstream&gt;</U></B><br>
  Some earlier versions of gcc were not supplied with the sstream include file. You can get it
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2000-q2/msg00700/sstream">here</a>

  <br><br>
  <U><B>Under Visual Studio .NET, my build fails during the custom build step</U></B><br>
  For some reason Visual Studio .NET reacts differently to errors in the custom build step then
  MSDEV 6.0. The easiest fix is to simply copy all the header files from your <I>quickfix/src/C++</I>
  directory to your <I>quickfix/include</I> directory. The build should be succesful on your next attempt.

  <U><B>After running <I>./configure</I> on *nix, the test checking for recursive mutex fails.</U></B><br>
  Currently, QuickFIX relies on the presence of recursive mutexes for synchronization. Some versions
  of some unices may not support these. One example would be Solaris 2.6. This will limit the ability
  to use QuickFIX on some systems until we implement a more portable solution. Linux and Solaris 8.0/SunOS 5.6
  do support recursive mutexes.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>After running <I>make</I> on *nix, I get an error that says <I>libtool: ltconfig version `' does not match ltmain.sh version `1.3.5'</I></U></B><br>
  Run the <I>./bootstrap</I> script, then run <I>make</I> again.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>During compilation, the compiler has errors in MessageValidator.cpp pertaining to the xml code</U></B><br>
  QuickFIX is not yet searching for libxml in the configure script. Check to make sure that libxml is installed
  and that the correct include and library directories are being passed into the compiler.  You may have to
  modify the configure.in file to do this.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>When I try to compile my application, it complains PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE is not defined</U></B><br>
  On some systems, you need to define _XOPEN_SOURCE as 500 in order to use recursive mutexes.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>When running my application under *nix, it crashes with a segmentation fault.</U></B><br>
  Make sure you have exceptions enabled with the <I>-fexceptions</I> flag. Also make sure you
  are catching any exceptions which need to be handled. QuickFIX does make use of the <I>throw</I>
  specifier in all function definitions which throw exceptions. If you are still having problems,
  verify that you are using the latest stable release of gcc. Some earlier versions have severe bugs
  with exception handling.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>When running my application under Linux, it crashes with a SIG_ABRT.</U></B><br>
  Linux will always crash with a SIG_ABRT if an exception is thrown from a shared library. Under Linux
  you cannot link QuickFIX dynamically, nor can you use it inside a dynamically loaded code segment.
  QuickFIX must be linked statically into your application. We are currently investigating possible
  workarounds for this.

  <br><br>
  <U><B>Can I build quickfix on *nix with a compiler other than gcc?</U></B><br>
  Probably. We have been able to compile it with icc as well. You can always verify your compilation
  by running the suite of unit and acceptance tests against your build.
