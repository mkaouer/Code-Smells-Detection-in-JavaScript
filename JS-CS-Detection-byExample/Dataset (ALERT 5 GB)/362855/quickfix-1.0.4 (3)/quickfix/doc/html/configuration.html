  </head>
  <body>
  <p>
  A quickfix acceptor or initiator can maintain as many FIX sessions as you would like. A FIX
  session is defined in QuickFIX as a unique combination of a <B>BeginString</B> (the FIX version number),
  a <B>SenderCompID</B> (your ID), and a <B>TargetCompID</B> (the ID of your counterparty).
  </p>
  <p>
  Each of the sessions can have several settings associated with them. Some of these setting may
  not be known at compile time and are therefore passed around in a class called SessionSettings
  which acts as a data dictionary that can be queried.
  </p>
  <p>
  The SessionSettings class has the ability to pull settings out of any c++ stream such as a file
  stream. You can also simply pass it a filename. If you decide to write your own  components,
  (storage for a particular database, a new kind of connector etc...), you may also use this to
  store settings.
  </p>

  <p>
  A settings file is set up with two types of heading, a [DEFAULT] and a [SESSION] heading. [SESSION]
  tells QuickFIX that a new Session is being defined. [DEFAULT] is a place that you can define settings
  which will be associated with sessions that don't explicitly define them. QuickFIX itself will not
  define any default settings for you. If you do not provide a setting that QuickFIX needs, it will
  throw a ConfigError telling you what setting is missing or improperly formatted.
  </p>
  <p>
  These are the settings you can associate with a session based on the default
  components provided with QuickFIX, followed by an example.
  </p>
