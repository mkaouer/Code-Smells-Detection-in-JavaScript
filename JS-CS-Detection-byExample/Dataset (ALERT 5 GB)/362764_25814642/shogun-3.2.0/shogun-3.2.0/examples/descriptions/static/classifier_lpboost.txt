In this example a two-class linear programming machine (LPM) classifier is
trained on a randomly generated examples. As solver the LPBOOST algorithm is
used with the regularization parameter C=100 and the bias term in the
classification rule switched off. Note that LPBOOST calls the CPLEX solver in
its inner loop hence the CPLEX must be installed. The trained classifier is used
to compute outputs on the training examples and the primal SVM objective
function is computed.
