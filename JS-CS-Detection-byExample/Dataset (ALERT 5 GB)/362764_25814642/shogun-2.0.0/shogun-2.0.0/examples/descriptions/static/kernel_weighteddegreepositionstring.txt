The Weighted Degree Position String kernel (Weighted Degree kernel with shifts).

The WD-shift kernel of order d compares two sequences X and
Y of length L by summing all contributions of k-mer matches of
lengths k in 1...d, weighted by coefficients beta_k
allowing for a positional tolerance of up to shift s.
