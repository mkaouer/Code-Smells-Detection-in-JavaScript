This example illustrates how to do ocr of handwritten digits.

./predict  - Starts a GUI where one can draw digits with the mouse.
             Pressing the classify button will detect the drawn digit
             (so does pressing the middle mouse button). Pressing the right
             mouse button will clear the window.

./train    - Does model selection using a SVM with a Gaussian kernel and saves the
            'best' model.
