  ///    create_tmpfile().
  /// 2. It represents the life of the associated file.  The file is
  ///    erased as soon as the temporary_file instance is destroyed.
  ///
  /// Note that there are two ways to destroy temporary_file
  /// instances.  Either directly with delete, or indirectly by
  /// calling cleanup_tmpfiles().
  /// You should never delete an instance that has been created
  /// before the last call to cleanup_tmpfiles(), because that
  /// instance has already been deleted.
