  /// \brief Construct a simplified TA by merging bisimilar states.
  ///
  /// A TA automaton can be simplified by merging bisimilar states:
  /// Two states are bisimilar if the automaton can accept the
  ///    same executions starting for either of these states. This can be
  /// achieved using any algorithm based on partition refinement
  ///
  /// For more detail about this type of algorithm, see the following paper:
