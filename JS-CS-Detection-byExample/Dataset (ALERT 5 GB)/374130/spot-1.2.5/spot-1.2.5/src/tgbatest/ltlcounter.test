# Kristin Y. Rozier reported that the formulae with n=10 were badly
# translated.  Each of these formulae should have exactly one
# accepting path, but in this case the emptiness returned an automata
# without cycle.  It turned out the function used to compare LTL
# formulae was bugged when two LTL formulae had the same hash value,
# so the translation of the formula stopped midway, on a formula it
# thought it had already seen.
