This contains most of the a benchmark used for the paper

  "Compositional Approach to Suspension and Other Improvements to LTL
  Translation", Tomáš Babiak, Thomas Badie, Alexandre Duret-Lutz,
  Mojmír Křetínský, and Jan Strejček.

To appear in the proceedings of Spin'13.

By "most" we means that some lines of the table we actually be missing
because we cannot compute them with the current version of Spot.  The
missing lines are those with a small "a", that use the old SCC-based
simplification, and not the new one which is presented in section 4.1
of the paper.

If you have any interest in reproducing the data from the paper, using
exactly the same versions (yes, that's a plural), please head over to
  http://www.lrde.epita.fr/~adl/spin13/

Keep in mind that as Spot is evolving, the results from this benchmark
may evolve (hopefully for the best!) with time.


Running instructions
====================

To run the benchmark:

  1) Now configure and compile the current tarball with
       ./configure --disable-shared --disable-devel
       make
     but to not install it.
  2) Go to directory bench/spin13/ and run the script "run.sh",
     this will just build "run.mk"
  3) Run "make -f run.mk -j4", adjusting "-j8" to the number of
     cores that your computer have.

The run.mk makefile will launch several instances of ltlcross in
parallel (depending on the -j argument).  There are 22 of them
to run in total.  Once that is done, the different data are
collated into a LaTeX file (using the ../ltl2tgba/sum.py script)
which is then compiled to PDF (using latexmk).  Finally, all
data are compacted into a tarball named with the date.


Results
=======

The results are more detailed that Table 1 in the Spin'13 paper.

ba-sum.pdf and tgba-sum.pdf show the main results over several sets
of formulae:
 - known.ltl is the set described in the paper;
 - new-fair3.ltl.pos is what we call fair3.ltl in the paper;
 - new-strong2.ltl.pos is what we call strong2.ltl in the paper.
The extra sets are:
 - new-ltl.pos: the set of random \varphi_i formula used to build
                new-fair3.ltl.pos and new-strong2.ltl.pos;
 - new-fair2.ltl.pos: the above formulae combined with weak
                fairness hypothesis of the form (FG(a)->GF(b));
 - new-strong1.ltl.pos: simimular to strong2 but using only
                one strong fairness hypothesis of the form
                (GF(a)->GF(b)).

Additionally, for all *.ltl.pos files, we have an *.ltl.neg file that
contains the negated formulas.

These 11 sets are translated to TGBA or BA using different
translation configurations.  Many of the configurations should be
recognized from the name in the paper.  The "Early" lines describe
an extra experiement (not discussed in the paper), where
composition of the suspended subformula starts on the transition
that enters an accepting SCC (not in the SCC itself).

In addition to the summaries in ba-sum.pdf and tgba-sum.pdf, detailled
results are provided as CSV files, slightly better formated JSON
files, and in HTML pages that can be used to explore the results
interactively.  (It probably does not work with Internet Explorer.  If
you have problems, install FireFox or Chrome.)
