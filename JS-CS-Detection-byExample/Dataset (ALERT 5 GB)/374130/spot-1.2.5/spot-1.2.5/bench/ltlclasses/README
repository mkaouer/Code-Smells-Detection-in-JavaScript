This benchmark plots the performance of the ltl2tgba_fm algorithm
for translating some classes of LTL formula.

Execute "./run" to compute the raw numbers, then execute
"gnuplot plot.gnu" to plot the figures.

The authors of the following paper defined 5 classes of LTL formulae
to stress the LTL-to-Büchi translators.
