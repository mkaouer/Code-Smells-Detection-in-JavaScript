In the following paper by Rozier & Vardi, a class of LTL formula
describing counters was used to stress many translators.

@InProceedings{	  rozier.07.spin,
  author	= {Kristin Y. Rozier and Moshe Y. Vardi},
  title		= {LTL Satisfiability Checking},
  booktitle	= {Proc. the 12th International SPIN Workshop on
		  Model Checking of Software (SPIN'07)},
  pages		= {149--167},

}

For a description of these formulae, you may also see

This benchmark used this familly of formulae to plot the performance
of the ltl2tgba_fm algorithm.  Studying the behaviour of ltl2tgba_fm
on this class of formulae helped us to improve the translation.

Execute "./run" to compute the raw numbers, then execture
"gnuplot plot.gnu" to plot the figures.
