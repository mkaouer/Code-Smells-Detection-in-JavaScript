# latexmk produces its output in the current directory, and may not
# update its timestamp when no rebuild was necessary.  This can cause
# latexmk to be called again and again even when there is nothing to
# do, and this is unacceptable (we don't want to require latexmk for
# people that do not change the documentation).  Hence the "touch"
# below.  In case of a VPATH build, we always copy the file, so the
# timestamp is updated anyway.
