  /// \brief A Transition-based Generalized Büchi Automaton.
  /// \ingroup tgba_essentials
  ///
  /// The acronym TGBA (Transition-based Generalized Büchi Automaton)
  /// was coined by Dimitra Giannakopoulou and Flavio Lerda
  /// in "From States to Transitions: Improving Translation of LTL
  /// Formulae to Büchi Automata".  (FORTE'02)
  ///
  /// TGBAs are transition-based, meanings their labels are put
  /// on arcs, not on nodes.  They use Generalized Büchi acceptance
  /// conditions: there are several acceptance sets (of
  /// transitions), and a path can be accepted only if it traverses
  /// at least one transition of each set infinitely often.
  ///
  /// Browsing such automaton can be achieved using two functions:
  /// \c get_init_state, and \c succ_iter.  The former returns
  /// the initial state while the latter lists the
  /// successor states of any state.
  ///
  /// Note that although this is a transition-based automata,
  /// we never represent transitions!  Transition informations are
  /// obtained by querying the iterator over the successors of
  /// a state.
