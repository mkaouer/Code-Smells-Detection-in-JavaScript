  /// \brief Loopless modular mixed radix Gray code iteration.
  /// \ingroup misc_tools
  ///
  /// This class is based on the loopless modular mixed radix gray
  /// code algorithm described in exercise 77 of "The Art of Computer
  /// Programming", Pre-Fascicle 2A (Draft of section 7.2.1.1:
  /// generating all n-tuples) by Donald E. Knuth.
  ///
  /// The idea is to enumerate the set of all n-tuples
  /// (a<sub>0</sub>,a<sub>1</sub>,...,a<sub>n-1</sub>) where each
  /// a<sub>j</sub> range over a distinct set (this is the <i>mixed
  /// radix</i> part), so that only one a<sub>j</sub> changes between
  /// two successive tuples of the iteration (that is the <i>Gray
  /// code</i> part), and that this changes occurs always in the same
  /// direction, cycling over the set a<sub>j</sub> must cover (i.e.,
  /// <i>modular</i>).  The algorithm is <i>loopless</i> in that
  /// computing the next tuple done without any loop, i.e., in
  /// constant time.
  ///
  /// This class does not need to know the type of the a<sub>j</sub>,
  /// it will handle them indirectly through three methods: a_first(),
  /// a_next(), and a_last().  These methods need to be implemented
  /// in a subclass for the particular type of a<sub>j</sub> at hand.
  ///
  /// The class itself offers four functions to control the iteration
  /// over the set of all the (a<sub>0</sub>,a<sub>1</sub>,...,
  /// a<sub>n-1</sub>) tuples: first(), next(), last(), and done().
  /// These functions are usually used as follows:
  /// \code
  ///    for (g.first(); !g.done(); g.next())
  ///       use the tuple
  /// \endcode
  /// How to use the tuple of course depends on the way
  /// it as been stored in the subclass.
  ///
  /// Finally, let's mention two differences between this algorithm
  /// and the one in Knuth's book.  This version of the algorithm does
  /// not need to know the radixes (i.e., the size of set of each
  /// a<sub>j</sub>) beforehand: it will discover them on-the-fly when
  /// a_last(j) first return true.  It will also work with
  /// a<sub>j</sub> that cannot be changed.  (This is achieved by
  /// reindexing the elements through \c non_one_radixes_, to consider
  /// only the elements with a non-singleton range.)
