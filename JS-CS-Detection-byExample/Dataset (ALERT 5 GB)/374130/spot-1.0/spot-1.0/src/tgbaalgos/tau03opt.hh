  /// \brief Returns an emptiness checker on the spot::tgba automaton \a a.
  ///
  /// \pre The automaton \a a must have at least one acceptance condition.
  ///
  /// During the visit of \a a, the returned checker stores explicitely all
  /// the traversed states. The implemented algorithm is the following:
  ///
  /// \verbatim
  /// procedure check ()
  /// begin
  ///   weight = 0; // the null vector
  ///   call dfs_blue(s0);
  /// end;
  ///
  /// procedure dfs_blue (s)
  /// begin
  ///   s.color = cyan;
  ///   s.acc = emptyset;
  ///   s.weight = weight;
  ///   for all t in post(s) do
  ///     let (s, l, a, t) be the edge from s to t;
  ///     if t.color == white then
  ///       for all b in a do
  ///         weight[b] = weight[b] + 1;
  ///       end for;
  ///       call dfs_blue(t);
  ///       for all b in a do
  ///         weight[b] = weight[b] - 1;
  ///       end for;
  ///     end if;
  ///     Acc = s.acc U a;
  ///     if t.color == cyan &&
  ///               (Acc U support(weight - t.weight) U t.acc) == all_acc then
  ///       report a cycle;
  ///     else if Acc not included in t.acc then
  ///       t.acc := t.acc U Acc;
  ///       call dfs_red(t, Acc);
  ///     end if;
  ///   end for;
  ///   s.color = blue;
  /// end;
  ///
  /// procedure dfs_red(s, Acc)
  /// begin
  ///   for all t in post(s) do
  ///     let (s, l, a, t) be the edge from s to t;
  ///     if t.color == cyan &&
  ///                 (Acc U support(weight - t.weight) U t.acc) == all_acc then
  ///       report a cycle;
  ///     else if t.color != white and Acc not included in t.acc then

  /// This algorithm is a generalisation to TGBA of the one implemented in

  /// of states used in spot::explicit_tau03_search. Moreover, it introduce
  /// a slight optimisation based on vectors of integers counting for each
  /// acceptance condition how many time the condition has been visited in
  /// the path stored in the blue stack. Such a vector is associated to each
  /// state of this stack.
