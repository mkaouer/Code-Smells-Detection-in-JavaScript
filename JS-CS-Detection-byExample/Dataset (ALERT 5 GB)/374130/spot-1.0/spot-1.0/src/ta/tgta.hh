  /// \brief A Transition-based Generalized Testing Automaton (TGTA).
  /// \ingroup ta_essentials
  ///
  ///  Transition-based Generalized Testing Automaton (TGTA) is a new kind of
  /// automaton that combines features from both TA and TGBA.
  /// From TA, we take the idea of labeling transitions with changesets,
  /// however we remove the use of livelock-acceptance (because it may require
  /// a two-pass emptiness check), and the implicit stuttering.  From TGBA, we
  /// inherit the use of transition-based generalized acceptance conditions.
  ///  The resulting Chimera, which we call \emph{Transition-based
  ///  Generalized Testing Automaton} (TGTA), accepts only
  ///  stuttering-insensitive languages like TA, and inherits advantages from
  ///  both TA and TGBA: it has a simple one-pass emptiness-check procedure
  /// (the same as algorithm the one for TGBA), and can benefit from reductions
  ///  based on the stuttering of the properties pretty much like a TA.
  ///  Livelock acceptance states, which are no longer supported are emulated
  ///using states with a Büchi accepting self-loop labeled by empty changeset.
  ///
  /// Browsing such automaton can be achieved using two functions:
  /// \c get_initial_state and \c
  /// succ_iter. The former returns the initial state(s) while the latter lists
  /// the successor states of any state. A second implementation of \c succ_iter
  /// returns only the successors reached through a changeset passed as
  /// a parameter.
  ///
  /// Note that although this is a transition-based automata,
  /// we never represent transitions!  Transition informations are
  /// obtained by querying the iterator over the successors of
  /// a state.
