lbtt version 1.0.2
------------------

lbtt is a tool for testing programs that translate formulas
expressed in propositional linear temporal logic (LTL) into
Büchi automata.  The goal of the tool is to assist in the
correct implementation of LTL-to-Büchi translation algorithms
by providing an automated testing environment for LTL-to-Büchi
translators.  Additionally, the testing environment can be used
for very basic profiling of different LTL-to-Büchi translators
to evaluate their performance.

The latest version of the program is available at

Quick installation instructions:
--------------------------------

    The basic procedure to build lbtt, the associated tools
    and GNU info documentation is to enter the following
    commands in the top-level package directory (the directory
    that contains this file):

        ./configure
        make

    These commands should create two executable files
    (`lbtt' and `lbtt-translate') in the `src' subdirectory
    and GNU info documentation under the `doc' subdirectory.
    The program and documentation can be used directly in
    their build directories.  Optionally, the program binaries
    and documentation can be installed in their default
    location (under `/usr/local/') by entering the command

        make install

    after the build process is complete.  (To change the
    default installation directory, the `configure' script
    should be invoked with an appropriate `--prefix=PATH'
    option before running `make'.  Please see the file INSTALL
    for generic information about running `configure'.)


Documentation:
--------------

    The default build procedure builds the program documentation
    in the `doc' subdirectory only in `info' format.  Assuming
    you have the GNU Info documentation browser installed, the
    documentation can be viewed by running the command
    `info -f doc/lbtt.info' after the program build is
    complete.

    The documentation can be optionally generated in DVI
    or HTML formats using the TeX typesetting program and the
    GNU texinfo tools.  To create DVI documentation, run the
    command

        make dvi

    in the top-level package directory.  If you have TeX and
    the GNU texinfo tools properly installed, this command
    should generate a file `lbtt.dvi' in the `doc' subdirectory.

    The documentation can be also generated in HTML format by
    running `makeinfo --html' on the file `lbtt.texi' in the
    `doc' subdirectory.

    Note: The generated DVI or HTML files refer to two
    auxiliary picture files (`testprocedure.EXT' and
    `intersectioncheck.EXT', where EXT stands for `eps' for
    DVI documentation, `png' for HTML documentation)
    residing in the `doc' subdirectory.  To see the figures
    included in the documentation correctly, make sure that
    the program used for viewing the documentation can find
    these files when needed.

    The documentation is also available in various formats
    at the program's home page at
    <http://www.tcs.hut.fi/Software/lbtt/>.
