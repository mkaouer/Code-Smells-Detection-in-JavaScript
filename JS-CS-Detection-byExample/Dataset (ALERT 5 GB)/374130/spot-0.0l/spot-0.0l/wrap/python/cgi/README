ltl2tgba.py is a CGI script that translate user-supplied LTL formulae
to Transition-based Generalized Büchi Automata.

You have to install the script yourself if you want to test it.

1) Install Spot first (run `make install' from the top-level).

   The CGI scripts uses the Python bindings and assume they
   have been installed.  Near the top of the script, you
   should see a call to sys.path.insert(), with the expected
   location og the Python bindings for spot.  This path was
   configured from ./configure's arguments and you should not
   have to fiddle with it.  I'm mentionning it just in case.

2) Copy ltl2tgba.py to some place were CGI execution is allowed.
   Depending on your HTTP server's configuration, you may have
   to rename the script as ltl2tgba.cgi or something else, so
   that the server accept to run it.

   Apache users in trouble should look at the following options
   before digging the Apache manual deeper.  These can go
   in a .htaccess file (if allowed).

      # Treat *.py files as CGI scripts
      AddHandle cgi-script .py

      # Allow CGI execution in some directory.
      Options +ExecCGI

3) In the directory where you have installed ltl2tgba.py,
   create a subdirectory called spotimg/.  This is where
   the script will output its images and other temporary
   files.  (If you want to change this name, see the imgdir
   variable at the top of the script.)

   This directory must be writable by the Unix user that
   will run the script when the HTTP server processes the
   request.

   ltl2tgba purges old files (>10min) from this directory
   each time it runs.

4) `dot' from the GraphViz package, and `convert' from
   the ImageMagick package should be in the PATH.
