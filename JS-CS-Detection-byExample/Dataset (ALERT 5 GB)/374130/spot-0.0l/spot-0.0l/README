Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Spot requires a complete installation of Python (version 2.0 or
later).  Especially, Python's headers files should be installed.

Spot also uses modified versions of BuDDy (a binary decision diagram),
and LBTT (an LTL to Büchi test bench).  You do not need to install
these yourself, they are included in this package (directories buddy/
and lbtt/), and will built and installed alongside of Spot.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Spot follows the traditional `./configure && make && make check &&
make install' process.  People unfamiliar with the GNU Build System
should read the file INSTALL for generic instructions.

In additions to its usual options, ./configure will accept some
flags specific to Spot:

  --with-gspn=DIR
    Turns on GreatSPN support.  DIR should designate the root of
    GreatSPN source tree.  (./configure will then run
    DIR/SOURCES/contrib/version.sh to find the GreatSPN build tree.)

    GreatSPN had to be modified in order to be used as a library
    (thanks Soheib Baarir and Yann Thierry-Mieg for this work), and
    presently these modifications are only available on the GreatSPN
    CVS repository hosted by the Università di Torino.

  --with-included-buddy
  --with-included-lbtt
    Once you have installed Spot the first time.  Modified versions of
    LBTT and BuDDy will be installed.  The next time you reconfigure
    Spot, configure will detect that these versions are already
    installed, and will attempt to use these installed versions
    directly (this is in case you had to modify one of these yourself
    for another purpose).  These two options will *force* the use,
    build, and installation of the included versions of these package,
    even when compatible versions are already installed.

  --enable-devel
    Enable debugging symbols, turn off aggressive optimizations, and
    turn on assertions.  This options is effective by default in
    development versions (version numbers ending with a letter).
