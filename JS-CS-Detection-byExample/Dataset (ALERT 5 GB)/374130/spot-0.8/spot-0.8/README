Keeping in touch
================

If you have questions regarding Spot, a bug reports, please send them
to <spot@lrde.epita.fr>.  This is a public mailing list which you may
subscribe to at https://www.lrde.epita.fr/mailman/listinfo/spot but you
should feel free to post without subscribing.

We also run an extremely low traffic list for announcements of
new releases of Spot.  You may subscribe to that list at

Installation
============

Requirements
------------

Spot requires a complete installation of Python (version 2.0 or
later).  Especially, Python's headers files should be installed.

Spot also uses modified versions of BuDDy (a binary decision diagram),
and LBTT (an LTL to Büchi test bench).  You do not need to install
these yourself: they are included in this package (directories buddy/
and lbtt/) and will be built and installed alongside of Spot.


Building and installing
-----------------------

Spot follows the traditional `./configure && make && make check &&
make install' process.  People unfamiliar with the GNU Build System
should read the file INSTALL for generic instructions.

In addition to its usual options, ./configure will accept some
flags specific to Spot:

  --with-gspn=DIR
    Turns on GreatSPN support.  DIR should designate the root of
    GreatSPN source tree.  (./configure will then run
    DIR/SOURCES/contrib/version.sh to find the GreatSPN build tree.)

    GreatSPN had to be modified in order to be used as a library
    (thanks Soheib Baarir and Yann Thierry-Mieg for this work), and
    presently these modifications are only available on the GreatSPN
    CVS repository hosted by the Università di Torino.

  --with-included-buddy
  --with-included-lbtt
    After you have installed Spot the first time, LBTT and a modified
    version of BuDDy will be installed.  The next time you reconfigure
    Spot, configure will detect that these versions are already
    installed, and will attempt to use these installed versions
    directly (this is in case you had to modify one of these yourself
    for another purpose).  These two options will *force* the use,
    build, and installation of the included versions of these package,
    even when compatible versions are already installed.

  --enable-devel
    Enable debugging symbols, turn off aggressive optimizations, and
    turn on assertions.  This option is effective by default in
    development versions (version numbers ending with a letter).
    It is equivalent to
      --enable-debug
      --enable-warnings
      --enable-assert
      --enable-optimizations=-O
  --disable-devel
    Disable development options.  This is the case by default in
    releases (version numbers NOT ending with a letter).
    It is equivalent to
      --disable-debug
      --disable-warnings
      --disable-assert
      --enable-optimizations

Here are the meaning of the fine-tuning options, in case
enable/disable-devel is not enough.

  --disable-assert
  --enable-assert
    Control assertion checking.

  --disable-warnings
  --enable-warnings
    Whether warnings should be output.  Note that during development
    we consider warnings to be errors.

  --disable-debug
  --enable-debug
    Whether to compile extra debugging code.

  --enable-optimizations
  --enable-optimizations=FLAGS
  --disable-optimizations
    Whether the compilation should be optimized.  When FLAGS are
    given, use these as optimization flags.  Otherwise, pick working
    flags from a built-in list.
