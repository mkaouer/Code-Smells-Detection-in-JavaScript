/** A RegionGraph inherits from a FactorGraph and adds additional structure in the form of a "region graph". Our definition of region graph
 *  is inspired by [\ref HAK03], which is less general than the definition given in [\ref YFW05].
 *
 *  The extra structure described by a RegionGraph over that described by a FactorGraph is:
 *  - a set of outer regions (indexed by \f$\alpha\f$), where each outer region consists of
 *    - a factor defined on a subset of variables
 *    - a counting number
 *  - a set of inner regions (indexed by \f$\beta\f$), where each inner region consists of
 *    - a subset of variables
 *    - a counting number
 *  - edges between inner and outer regions
 *
 *  Each factor in the factor graph belongs to an outer region; normally, the factor contents
 *  of an outer region would be the product of all the factors that belong to that region.
