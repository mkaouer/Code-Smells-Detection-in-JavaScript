# This template contains configurations for compiling libDAI with Visual C++
# under Windows (and GNU Make)
#
# It has been tested with Windows XP, Visual Studio 2008, MatLab R2008b and
# Boost 1.42.0
#
# To use it, simply copy this file to 'Makefile.conf' and adapt 'Makefile.conf'
# to your local setup


# OPERATING SYSTEM
# Choose OS from {LINUX, WINDOWS, CYGWIN, MACOSX}
OS=WINDOWS

# FILE EXTENSIONS
# Static library
LE=.lib
# Object file
OE=.obj
# Binary executable
EE=.exe
# MatLab compiled MEX file

# Compile using Visual C++ Compiler
CC=cl
# Output filename option of the compiler

# Flags for the C++ compiler
CCFLAGS=/EHac /GR /W3 /DWINDOWS /DNOMINMAX /MD
# For MatLab R2008b, the following flag seems to be necessary: /D_SECURE_SCL=0
# but it generates exceptions in normal executables... therefore, the MatLab 
# interface is now built from source completely using mex
