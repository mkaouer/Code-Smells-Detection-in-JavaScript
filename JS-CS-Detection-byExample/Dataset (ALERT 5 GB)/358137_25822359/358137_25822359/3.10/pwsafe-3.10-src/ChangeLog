2007-09-01 [r1662]  c-273:

	* [1632634] Compare no longer changes database settings when the
	  databases are identical

2007-09-01 [r1661]  c-273:

	* Update release notes for last XML Notes export/import fix

2007-09-01 [r1660]  c-273:

	* Remove entry from Release Notes after new function removed

	* [1782407] Export to text file now includes "title", if selected.

	* Reset lock timer during D&D

2007-08-31 [r1654]  ronys:

	* Tweaked import text - quoted qoutes no longer unquoted.

2007-08-30 [r1652-1653]  ronys:

	* Bumped version to 3.10

	* [1783905] Read-only status maintained after unlocking a database.

2007-08-28 [r1651]  ronys:

	* Removed unrestricted clipboard clearing function [1765240] - not
	  really passwordsafe related, also, caused an assertion failure in
	  MFC in debug build.

2007-08-28 [r1650]  ronys:

	* typo

2007-08-28 [r1649]  ronys:

	* - "Unilateral" -> "Unconditional" re clearing clipboard. - Minor
	  tweak for import text blank suppression - Tree sorting now
	  cleaner, more consistent and *correct* after d&d, edit label,
	  etc.

2007-08-27 [r1648]  ronys:

	* Removed Find() in Read that would result on O(n^2) complexity -
	  duplicate group/title/user entries are protected against
	  elsewhere, and do NOT cause crashes.

2007-08-27 [r1647]  ronys:

	* Delete doesn't get confused if two entries have same
	  group/title/user, and is more efficient to boot.

2007-08-27 [r1646]  c-273:

	* Add Report to Validate function

2007-08-27 [r1645]  c-273:

	* Complete the rejection of bad records during ImportPlaintextFile

2007-08-27 [r1644]  c-273:

2007-08-26 [r1643]  ronys:

	* Refactor whitespace handling

2007-08-26 [r1642]  c-273:

	* As using UTF-8 in D&D, permit D&D between U <-> NU instances

2007-08-26 [r1641]  c-273:

	* [] Add/Edit - Treat fields containing only whitespace as empty

2007-08-25 [r1640]  c-273:

	* Improved reporting for ImportPlaintextFile.

2007-08-25 [r1639]  c-273:

	* [1765240] Add "Clear clipboard" item to tray icon context menu.

	* Nearly fix D&D hilite problem

2007-08-24 [r1637]  c-273:

	* [] Ensure group/title/user combination is unique when opening a
	  database.

2007-08-24 [r1636]  c-273:

	* Implement Report for ImportPlaintextFile Ensure group/title/user
	  combination is unique during ImportPlaintextFile

2007-08-24 [r1635]  c-273:

	* Add Report to Merge function + tweaks to CReport.

2007-08-24 [r1634]  c-273:

	* Implement CReport class

2007-08-23 [r1633]  ronys:

	* [1754054, 1754611] Items are now fully sorted when "put groups
	  first in display tree" selected.

2007-08-22 [r1631]  ronys:

	* Merged in dk-serialize branch.

2007-08-22 [r1630]  c-273:

	* Fix one Merge issue - need to check that was all

2007-08-22 [r1627]  ronys:

	* Slight improvement on select-after-drop

2007-08-22 [r1626]  ronys:

	* [1517048] PasswordSafe can now be installed as an msi package
	  (Windows installer). This allows site administrators to 'push'
	  PasswordSafe to client machines with group policy. Thanks to
	  xenophonf.

2007-08-20 [r1622]  c-273:

	* Display number of unknown fields present in entry (if > 0) during
	  edit or view

2007-08-20 [r1621]  c-273:

	* Fix NU compile problem in PWSdirs.cpp. Remove unused SetUseUTF8
	  routine and unnecessary m_useUTF8 variable

2007-08-20 [r1620]  ronys:

	* Do the whole Serialization thing at server only at the end of the
	  drop action, minimizing the time we have cleartext global data
	  floating around. Next step is to avoid
	  serialization/deserialization entirely when server == target.

2007-08-17 [r1619]  ronys:

	* [1771357] Timeout timer now reset in all dialog boxes -
	  PasswordSafe will no longer minimize in the middle of work with
	  an open dialog box. This was done by deriving all dialog boxes
	  except DboxMain off CPWDialog, which overrides the appropriate
	  method.

2007-08-16 [r1618]  ronys:

	* Don't save silently if user explicitly requested NOT to save,
	  plus minor cleanups.

2007-08-15 [r1617]  ronys:

	* First step in moving to lazy-evaluation model for D&D - don't
	  serialize objects until the actual drop. Ideally, serializa @
	  drop only for inter-process case, do what we used to do for
	  itra-process...

2007-08-15 [r1616]  ronys:

	* [1735290] (again) - now works correctly for Cyrillic text.

2007-08-15 [r1615]  ronys:

	* Update relnote + D&D nit

2007-08-14 [r1614]  ronys:

	* Removed vestigal and unnecessary selection in RefreshList() if
	  nothing to select - caused unwanted tree expansion when 1st list
	  entry happened to be a nested item.

2007-08-14 [r1613]  ronys:

	* Tree display state logic now works as expected.

2007-08-13 [r1612]  ronys:

	* More progress on cleaning up tree display state handling

2007-08-12 [r1611]  ronys:

	* Progress on cleaning up tree display state handling

2007-08-09 [r1610]  ronys:

	* Minor tweak with displayed text in tree view, started working on
	  getting expand/collapse state to be persistent across invocations
	  (broke somewhere along the last couple of releases).

2007-08-08 [r1609]  ronys:

	* If we're dragging between processes, default is to COPY, Ctrl key
	  changes this to MOVE. If we're dragging in the same process,
	  default is to MOVE, Ctrl key changes this to COPY. This is to
	  make it harder for a user to inadvertently remove data while
	  D&Ding. M'soft does something similar when dragging between
	  drives as opposed to different directories in the same drive.

2007-08-08 [r1607-1608]  ronys:

	* Document last fix...

	* Treat manual lock same as timeout lock, ensuring save if
	  modified, ensuring empty db isn't written if timeout hits after
	  manual lock.

2007-08-07 [r1606]  ronys:

	* (very) minor cleanup

2007-08-07 [r1605]  ronys:

	* [1768822] Manage->Options->Password History 'apply' works again.

2007-08-07 [r1604]  ronys:

	* Delete correctly upon inter-process move.

2007-08-06 [r1603]  ronys:

	* Updates size & position preference correctly.

2007-08-05 [r1602]  ronys:

	* Refactored serialization of CItem for d&d.

2007-08-05 [r1601]  ronys:

	* Inter-process copy/move now respected (latter causes removal of
	  selection @source)

2007-08-05 [r1600]  ronys:

	* User's delete "don't ask again" answer respected (again). Don't
	  ask this if deleting empty dbase Don't crash when nothing to
	  select in list view.

2007-08-05 [r1599]  ronys:

	* Cursor now behaves in a rational & consistent manner. Still room
	  for improvement, though.

2007-08-02 [r1598]  ronys:

	* Inter-process D&D now works - need to get a grip on cursor shapes
	  - more testing - refactor serialization code.

2007-08-02 [r1597]  ronys:

	* trashMemory now treats memory as RAM, and not as magnetic
	  media...

2007-08-01 [r1596]  ronys:

	* Renamed CMyTreeCtrl -> CPWTreeCtrl

2007-08-01 [r1595]  ronys:

	* Intra-process d&D works as before, only with OLE framework, based
	  on dk's d-n-d branch. Inter-process D&D should use same
	  framework, but is not yet debugged. Also to be done: - Rename
	  MyTCtrl to something less dorky - Support intra-process D&D copy
	  (in addition to move) - Support D&D under list view - Verify
	  column-picker unbroken.

2007-07-31 [r1594]  ronys:

	* Great D&D merge - checkpoint - compiles cleanly, dragging in
	  treeview (currently) totally broken.

2007-07-31 [r1593]  ronys:

	* Minor cleanups

2007-07-30 [r1592]  ronys:

	* One less global variable!

2007-07-30 [r1591]  ronys:

	* replace gbl_randID with GetCurrentProcessId() - one less global!

2007-07-30 [r1589]  ronys:

	* Finished last fix plus minor cleanup

2007-07-30 [r1588]  ronys:

	* [1758025, 1759364] '-s' option now works correctly

2007-07-29 [r1587]  ronys:

	* Bring clipboard implementation into the 21st century...

2007-07-29 [r1586]  ronys:

	* Murphy + a nit.

2007-07-29 [r1585]  ronys:

	* Made clipboard-related code a bit less inelegant...

2007-07-26 [r1584]  ronys:

	* -g config_file is now searched for in exec's directory (if it's
	  not an absolute path).

2007-07-25 [r1583]  ronys:

	* More elegant solution for DboxMain::UpdateToolBarForSelectedItem
	  upon exit, per dk's suggestion. (merge from D&D branch)

2007-07-24 [r1579]  c-273:

	* Forgotten members. Small but may be useful in many places

2007-07-21 [r1575]  c-273:

	* [1757110] Toolbar now correctly disables images according to type
	  of entry selected and if URL is populated

2007-07-21 [r1574]  c-273:

	* A few tweaks to external editor code

2007-07-20 [r1573]  c-273:

	  default text editor via right click on Notes field. Ability to
	  subvert Edit Control context menu generalised.

	  avoid including it in 3.09

	* Password history times now exported to XML correctly.

2007-07-12 [r1561]  ronys:

	* Simplify Properties display for common case of no unknown fields.

2007-07-12 [r1560]  ronys:

	* Finished format 0302 functionality + some cleaning up.

2007-07-11 [r1559]  ronys:

	  of 0x05 / 0x07&0x08 fields.

2007-07-11 [r1558]  ronys:

	* Write header last update time (0x05) as time_t, read both time_t

	* [1739979] Add URL column to flattened list

2007-06-19 [r1518]  c-273:

	* Use correct character for passphrase change

2007-05-14 [r1429]  ronys:

	* Cleaning up the unicode act: For V3, ReadCBC cannot be directly
	  into a string, as an array of wchar_t isn't always appropriate.
	  So we only read into a byte array, return length explicitly, and
	  treat as UTF-8 when appropriate.

2007-05-14 [r1428]  ronys:

	* Heisenbug quashed.

2007-05-14 [r1427]  ronys:

	* Advanced column chooser now works under unicode build.

2007-05-08 [r1413]  ronys:

	* Label editing (title/user) in tree mode now reflected correctly
	  in list view. Looks like there's a bug in m'soft's documentation,
	  in that the subItem index is zero-based, not one-based, with zero
	  meaning the item's title. Or perhaps this has been "fixed" over
	  the years and no-one bothered to update the help?

2007-05-08 [r1412]  ronys:

	* revert trunk back to pre-drag-n-drop merge (1406) with the
	  exception of fix to tinyxml (1409) and a minor bug in
	  DropSource.cpp

2007-05-08 [r1410]  ronys:

	* re-instated BeginDrag event for tree, instead of onlbtnclick.

	* Parse config files with non-ASCII file names correctly.

2007-05-07 [r1408]  ronys:

	* Minor cleanup - prefer automatic allocation to new/delete.

2007-05-07 [r1407]  ronys:

	* checkpoint - merge with branches/dk200703 1337:1382 -compiles

	  CMyString functions.

2007-04-15 [r1365]  ronys:

	* More unicode work - compiles cleanly under UNICODE (still doesn't
	  link), non-unicode unbroken.

2007-04-15 [r1363]  ronys:

	* corelib now compiles cleanly under unicode w/o breaking
	  non-unicode functionality (unicode version still untested)

2007-02-26 [r1272]  arjun_acharya:

	* Summary: CMyTreeCtrl::OnEndLabelEdit has been modified to prevent
	  editing of group/entry names via click of mouse Detailed: If one
	  clicks Group/Entry with left mouse button, waits a bit, and
	  clicks again (i.e. NOT double click), one can edit the name of
	  group/entry, even in read-only mode. The change of code in this
	  commit prevents this from being done.

2007-02-25 [r1271]  arjun_acharya:

	* DK's drag&drop patch has made "MoveGroupToTopLevel" functionality
	  redundant. Therefore all traces of this have been removed from
	  the current revision. All that remains from additions in revision
	  1266 is the m_TreeViewGroup = _T("") addition to DboxMain::Delete

2007-02-24 [r1270]  ronys:

	* Removed Move group to toplevel from popup menu - now possible to
	  do it entirely with D&D

2007-02-24 [r1267]  ronys:

	* Minor tweaks to MoveGroupToTop - normalize error handling

2007-02-23 [r1266]  arjun_acharya:

	* 1)Implemented function "Move Group To Top Level" which allows,
	  upon right click of mouse button, for group (and all
	  sub-elements) to be returned to top level. 2)Also made minor
	  modification to DboxMain::Delete so that we have m_TreeViewGroup
	  = _T("") at end. Without this line, one encounters a few
	  problems. For example suppose you (in version 3, 6, 1, 1265)
	  A)you add Group as soon as app opens, via edit menu. This creates
	  "New Group" folder B)click on whitespace, then highlight "New
	  Group" and delete this via right click of mouse C)add group again
	  via edit. This time "New Group" gets opened within "New Group"
	  instead of top level

2007-02-21 [r1265]  ronys:

	  fixes.
