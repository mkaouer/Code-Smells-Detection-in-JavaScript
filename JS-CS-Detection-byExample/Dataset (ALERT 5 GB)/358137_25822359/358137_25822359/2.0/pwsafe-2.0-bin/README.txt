Introduction:
=============
Password Safe is a password database utility. Like many other such
products, commercial and otherwise, it stores your passwords in an
encrypted file, allowing you to remember only one password (the "safe
combination"), instead of all the username/password combinations that
you use.

What makes Password Safe different? Three things:
1. Simplicity: Password Safe is designed to do one thing, and to do it
well. Start the application, enter your "combination", double-click on
the right entry - presto - the password is now on your clipboard,ready
for pasting.
2. Security: The original version was designed and written by Bruce
Schneier - 'nuff said.
3. Open Source: The source code for the project is available for
inspection. For more information, see http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net

Password Safe currently runs on Windows 95, 98, ME, NT4, 2000 and
XP, as well as Microsoft's PocketPC. Support for additional platforms
is planned for future releases. 

Downloading:
============
The latest & greatest version of Password Safe may be downloaded from
https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=41019

A Russian version of the help file may be found in
http://passwordsafe.sourceforge.net/pwsaferu.zip (Thanks to Maxim
Tikhonov). If anyone is interested in doing such work in other
languages, please let me (https://sourceforge.net/users/ronys) know.

Installation:
=============
Nothing special. No "Setup", no dependencies, no annoying wizard, no
need to sacrifice a goat and/or reboot your computer. Just extract the
files (using WinZip, for example) to any directory, double-click on
the Pwsafe.exe icon,and that's it. "Advanced" users may want to
create a shortcut to their desktop and/or Start menu.

License:
========
Password Safe is available under the restrictions set forth in the
standard "Artistic License". For more details, see the LICENSE file
that comes with the package.
