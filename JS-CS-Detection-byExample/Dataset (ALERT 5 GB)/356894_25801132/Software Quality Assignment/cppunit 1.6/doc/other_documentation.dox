 \section _history History
 The first port of JUnit to C++ was done
 by Michael Feathers. His versions
 can be found on the 
 <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/software.htm">
 XProgramming software page</a>. They are os-specific,
 so Jerome Lacoste provided a port to Unix/Solaris.
 His version can be found on the same page.
 The CppUnit project has combined and built on this work.

 \section _usage Usage
 Take a look into 
 the CppUnit <a href="cookbook.html">cookbook</a>.
 It gives a quick start into using this 
 testing framework.
 For a discussion on CppUnit, check 
 <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?CppUnit">

 find the original versions and various ports to other
 OSses and languages.
