SQL tables are used to represent abstract operating system concepts, such as running processes.

A table can be used in conjunction with other tables via operations like sub-queries and joins. This allows for a rich data exploration experience. While osquery ships with a default set of tables, osquery provides an API that allows you to create new tables.

You can explore current tables here: [https://osquery.io/tables](https://osquery.io/tables). Tables that are up for grabs in terms of development can be found on Github issues using the "virtual tables" + "[up for grabs tag](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22virtual+tables%22)".

## New Table Walkthrough

Let's walk through an exercise where we build a 'time' table. The table will have one row, and that row will have three columns: hour, minute, and second.

Column values (a single row) will be dynamically computed at query time.

**Table specifications**

Under the hood, osquery uses libraries from SQLite core to create "virtual tables". The default API for creating virtual tables is relatively complex. osquery has abstracted this complexity away, allowing you to write a simple table declaration.

To make table-creation simple osquery uses a *table spec* file.
The current specs are organized by operating system in the [specs](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/tree/master/specs) source folder.
For our time exercise, a spec file would look like the following:

```python
# This .table file is called a "spec" and is written in Python
# This syntax (several definitions) is defined in /tools/codegen/gentable/py.
table_name("time")

# Provide a short "one line" description, please use punctuation!
description("Returns the current hour, minutes, and seconds.")

# Define your schema, which accepts a list of Column instances at minimum.
# You may also describe foreign keys and "action" columns.
schema([
    # Declare the name, type, and documentation description for each column.
    # The supported types are INTEGER, BIGINT, TEXT, DATE, and DATETIME.
    Column("hour", INTEGER, "The current hour"),
    Column("minutes", INTEGER, "The current minutes past the hour"),
    Column("seconds", INTEGER, "The current seconds past the minute"),
])

# Use the "@gen{TableName}" to communicate the C++ symbol name.
implementation("genTime")
```

You can leave the comments out in your production spec. Shoot for simplicity, do NOT go "hard in the paint" and do things like inheritance for Column objects, loops in your table spec, etc.

You might wonder "this syntax looks similar to Python?". Well, it is! The build process actually parses the spec files as Python code and meta-programs necessary C/C++ implementation files.

**Where do I put the spec?**

You may be wondering how osquery handles cross-platform support while still allowing operating-system specific tables. The osquery build process takes care of this by only generating the relevant code based on a directory structure convention.

- Cross-platform: [specs/](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/tree/master/specs/)
- Mac OS X: [specs/darwin/](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/tree/master/specs/darwin)
- General Linux: [specs/linux/](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/tree/master/specs/linux)
- Ubuntu: [specs/ubuntu/](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/tree/master/specs/ubuntu)
- CentOS: [specs/centos/](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/tree/master/specs/centos)

Note: the CMake build provides custom defines for each platform and platform version.

**Creating your implementation**

As indicated in the spec file, our implementation will be in a function called `genTime`. Since this is a very general table and should compile on all supported operating systems we can place it in *osquery/tables/utility/time.cpp*. The directory *osquery/table/* contains the set of *specs* and implementation categories. Place implementations in the corresponding category using your best judgement.

Here is that code for *osquery/tables/utility/time.cpp*:

```cpp
// Copyright 2004-present Facebook. All Rights Reserved.

#include <ctime>
#include <osquery/tables.h>

namespace osquery {
namespace tables {

QueryData genTime(QueryContext &context) {
  Row r;
  QueryData results;

  time_t _time = time(0);
  struct tm* now = localtime(&_time);

  r["hour"] = INTEGER(now->tm_hour);
  r["minutes"] = INTEGER(now->tm_min);
  r["seconds"] = INTEGER(now->tm_sec);

  results.push_back(r);
  return results;
}
}
}
```

Key points to remember:

- Your implementation function should be in the `osquery::tables` namespace.
- Your implementation function should accept on `QueryContext&` parameter and return an instance of `QueryData`.

## Using where clauses

The `QueryContext` data type is osquery's abstraction of the underlying SQL engine's query parsing. It is defined in [include/osquery/tables.h](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/master/include/osquery/tables.h).

The most important use of the context is query predicate constraints (e.g., `WHERE col = 'value'`). Some tables MUST have a predicate constraint, others may optionally use the constraints to increase performance.

Examples:

`hash` requires a predicate, since the resultant rows are the hashes of the EQUALS constraint operators (`=`). The table implementation includes:
```cpp
  auto paths = context.constraints["path"].getAll(EQUALS);
  for (const auto& path_string : paths) {
    boost::filesystem::path path = path_string;
    [...]
  }
```

`processes` optionally uses a predicate. A syscall to list process pids requires few resources. Enumerating "/proc" information and parsing environment/argument uses MANY resources. The table implementation includes:
```cpp
  for (auto &pid : pidlist) {
    if (!context.constraints["pid"].matches<int>(pid)) {
      // Optimize by not searching when a pid is a constraint.
      continue;
    }
    [...]
  }
```

## SQL data types

Data types like `QueryData`, `Row`, `DiffResults`, etc. are osquery's built-in data result types. They're all defined in [include/osquery/database.h](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/master/include/osquery/database.h).

`Row` is just a `typedef` for a `std::map<std::string, std::string>`. That's it. A row of data is just a mapping of strings that represent column names to strings that represent column values. Note that, currently, even if your SQL table type is an `int` and not a `std::string`, we need to cast the ints as strings to comply with the type definition of the `Row` object. They'll be casted back to `int`s later. This is all handled transparently by osquery's supporting infrastructure as long as you use the macros like `TEXT`, `INTEGER`, `BIGINT`, etc. when inserting columns into your row.

`QueryData` is just a `typedef` for a `std::vector<Row>`. Query data is just a list of rows. Simple enough.

To populate the data that will be returned to the user at runtime, your implementation function must generate the data that you'd like to display and populate a `QueryData` map with the appropriate `Row`s. Then, just return the `QueryData`.

In our case, we used system APIs to create a struct of type `tm` which has fields such as `tm_hour`, `tm_min` and `tm_sec` which represent the current time. We can then create our three entries in our `Row` variable: hour, minutes and seconds. Then we push that single row onto the `QueryData` variable and return it. Note that if we wanted our table to have many rows (a more common use-case), we would just push back more `Row` maps onto `results`.

## Building new tables

If you've created a new file, you'll need to make sure that CMake properly builds your code. Open [osquery/tables/CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/facebook/osquery/blob/master/osquery/tables/CMakeLists.txt). Find the line that defines the library `osquery_tables` and add your file, "utility/time.cpp" to the sources which are compiled by that library.

If your table only works on OS X, find the target called `osquery_tables_darwin` and add your file to that list of sources instead. If your table only works on Linux, find the target called `osquery_tables_linux` and add your implementation file to that list of sources.

Return to the root of the repository and execute `make`. This will generate the appropriate code and link everything properly.

### Testing your table

If your code compiled properly, launch the interactive query console by executing `./build/[darwin|linux]/osquery/osqueryi` and try issuing your new table a command: `SELECT * FROM time;`.

### Getting your query ready for use in osqueryd

You don't have to do anything to make your query work in the osqueryd daemon. All osquery queries work in osqueryd. It's worth noting, however, that osqueryd is a long-running process. If your table leaks memory or uses a lot of systems resources, you will notice poor performance from osqueryd. For more information on ensuring a performant table, see [performance overview](../deployment/performance-safety.md).

When in doubt, use existing open source tables to guide your development.
