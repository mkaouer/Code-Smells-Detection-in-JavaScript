 * You may use flume, splunk, syslog, scribe, etc. In order to use your
 * specific upstream logging systems, one simply needs to create a custom
 * subclass of LoggerPlugin. That subclass should implement the
 * LoggerPlugin::logString method.
 *
 * Consider the following example:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 *   class TestLoggerPlugin : public LoggerPlugin {
 *    public:
 *     virtual osquery::Status logString(const std::string& s) {
 *       int i = 0;
 *       internal::logStringToFlume(s, i);
 *       std::string message;
 *       if (i == 0) {
 *         message = "OK";
 *       } else {
 *         message = "Failed";
 *       }
 *       return osquery::Status(i, message);
 *     }
 *  };
 *
 *  REGISTER(TestLoggerPlugin, "logger", "test");
