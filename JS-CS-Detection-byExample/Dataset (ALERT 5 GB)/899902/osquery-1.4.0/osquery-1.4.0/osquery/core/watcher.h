/**
 * @brief Daemon tools may want to continually spawn worker processes
 * and monitor their utilization.
 *
 * A daemon may call initWorkerWatcher to begin watching child daemon
 * processes until it-itself is unscheduled. The basic guarentee is that only
 * workers will return from the function.
 *
 * The worker-watcher will implement performance bounds on CPU utilization
 * and memory, as well as check for zombie/defunct workers and respawn them
 * if appropriate. The appropriateness is determined from heuristics around
 * how the worker exitted. Various exit states and velocities may cause the
 * watcher to resign.
 *
 * @param name The name of the worker process.
 * @param argc The daemon's argc.
 * @param argv The daemon's volitle argv.
