osquery is an operating system instrumentation framework for OS X and Linux.
The tools make low-level operating system analytics and monitoring both performant and intuitive.

osquery exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database. This allows you to write SQL-based queries to explore operating system data. With osquery, SQL tables represent abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.

## Getting Started

If you're interested in **installing osquery** check out the install guide for [OS X](installation/install-osx.md) and [Linux](installation/install-linux.md).

If you're interested in **deploying osquery** to provide your organization with deeper insight into your Linux and OS X hosts check out the [using osqueryd guide](introduction/using-osqueryd.md).
If you're interested in **performing ad-hoc queries**, check out [using osqueryi](introduction/using-osqueryi.md).

If you're interested in **extending one of the existing osquery products** or improving core libraries read the developer documentation pages. You should start with "[building the code](development/building.md)" and "[contributing code](development/contributing-code.md)".

If you're interested in **using osquery's functionality in your own tool**, check out the [osquery SDK](development/osquery-sdk.md).
