osquery is an operating system instrumentation framework for OS X and Linux. <br/>
The tools make low-level operating system analytics and monitoring both performant and intuitive.

#### What is osquery?

osquery exposes an operating system as a high-performance relational database. This allows you to write SQL-based queries to explore operating system data. With osquery, SQL tables represent abstract concepts such as running processes, loaded kernel modules, open network connections, browser plugins, hardware events or file hashes.

SQL tables are implemented via a simple plugin and extensions API. A variety of tables already exist and more are being written: [https://osquery.io/tables](https://osquery.io/tables). To best understand the expressiveness that is afforded to you by osquery, consider the following SQL queries:


List the the users:
```sql
SELECT * FROM users;
```

Check the processes that have a deleted executable:
```sql
SELECT * FROM processes WHERE on_disk = 0;
```

Get the process name, port, and PID, which are listening on all interfaces:
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT process.name, listening.port, process.pid
FROM processes AS process
JOIN listening_ports AS listening ON process.pid = listening.pid
WHERE listening.address = '0.0.0.0';
```

Find every OS X LaunchDaemon that launches an executable and keeps it running:
```sql
SELECT name, program || program_arguments AS executable
FROM launchd
WHERE
  (run_at_load = 'true' AND keep_alive = 'true')
AND
  (program != '' OR program_arguments != '');
```

Check for ARP anomalies from the host's perspective:

```sql
SELECT address, mac, count(mac) AS mac_count
FROM arp_cache GROUP BY mac
HAVING count(mac) > 1;
```

Alternatively, you could also use a SQL sub-query to accomplish the same result:

```sql
SELECT address, mac, mac_count
FROM
  (SELECT address, mac, count(mac) AS mac_count FROM arp_cache GROUP BY mac)
WHERE mac_count > 1;
```

These queries can be:
* performed on an ad-hoc basis to explore operating system state using the [osqueryi](https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction/using-osqueryi/) shell
* executed via a [scheduler](https://osquery.readthedocs.org/en/latest/introduction/using-osqueryd/) to monitor operating system state across a set of hosts
* launched from custom applications using osquery Thrift APIs

#### Downloads / Install
