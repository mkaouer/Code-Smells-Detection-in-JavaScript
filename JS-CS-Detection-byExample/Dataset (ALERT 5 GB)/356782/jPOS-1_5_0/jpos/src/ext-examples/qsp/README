Here you can explore different QSP examples. 

You should 'build ext-examples' before attemping to run qsp example.
(please have a look at jpos/etc/README for required jars)

Please note that Test.java is actually a wrapper that calls 
org.jpos.apps.qsp.QSP adjusting configuartion file path 
(adding src/ext-examples/qsp prefix to args[0] if present)
so you are able to call:

  example qsp dummyserver/dummyserver.xml

instead of:

  example qsp src/ext-examples/qsp/dummyserver/dummyserver.xml

For production environment you can 'build qsp' that will create
'dist/qsp-<version>.jar'. Have a look at src/etc/MANIFEST-QSP.MF,
'xalan.jar' and 'xerces.jar' have to be accesible at runtime
if you are to run 'java -jar qsp.jar'

dtd/qsp-config.dtd gets copied from src/ext/org/jpos/apps/qsp
by ext-examples's Ant target. CVSed qsp-config.dtd is there.

In order to test QSP examples we recommend that you try them
in the following order: (have a look at */README files)

   - dummyserver
   - dummyclient

There's a new example called dummydirpoll that shows how
to configure a DirPoll node within QSP configuration.
(see org.jpos.util.DirPoll class for details)
