QUICK INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------

  1) cd to jPOS's base directory 
  2) call bin/build jar javadoc

ABOUT OPTIONAL MODULES
----------------------
We currently distribute 2 modules: 'main' and 'ext'.

While 'main' module's classes are self contained, 'ext' module
requires external classes (to be installed in 'ext' directory,
see ext/README). If you need additional features you can consider
installing some or all these jars and building a new jpos.jar using 
the procedure mentioned above.

RUNNING THE EXAMPLES
--------------------
Have a look at src/examples/README for instructions about compiling
and playing with jPOS examples.

There's an "ext-examples" module that depends on some libraries
provided by the "ext" module.
