In order to build 'ext' module you will have to install here
(or anywhere within your CLASSPATH) the following files:

  - activation.jar and mail.jar (javax.mail available from sun)
    used by OperatorLogListener

  - sun-util.jar (available as part of Jini 1.1 distribution)
    used by ReliableSequencer

  - CommAPI (comm.jar) file and a CommAPI provider such as RXTX
    (http://www.rxtx.com) for Linux or Sun's CommAPI implementation
    for Windows.
