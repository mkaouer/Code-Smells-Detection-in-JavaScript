Please have a look at examples/channelfilter example first.

XSLTFilter is initialized with 'reread' param turned on, XSLT
source file will be read on every transaction.

You can pass a numeric value to xsltfilter in the command line
to set the number of message you want sent to simpleserver.

(i.e. example xsltfilter 100)

There's a 1 second delay between messages, you can edit and
save XSLT files (incoming.xsl and outgoing.xsl) while xsltfilter
example is running.
