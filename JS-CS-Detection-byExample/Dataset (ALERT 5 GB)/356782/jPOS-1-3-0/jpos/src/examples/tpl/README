This is a simple testbed for TPL debugging.

TPL is a minimalistic thin layer on top of JDBC intended to
be used in situations where you cannot afford a better solution
such as an EJB container.

In order to run it you have to create the following table:

CONNECT test;              <--- or your preferred database (see test.cfg)

CREATE TABLE nf (
    pan CHAR(19) NOT NULL,
    INDEX pan (pan)
);

We will be using TPL until we find an OpenSource, 
really thin and fast solution (such as a JSR012 JDO provider).
