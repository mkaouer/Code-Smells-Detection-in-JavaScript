ISOMsg is the most intensively used class within jPOS's iso package.

It's a Composite in terms of the "Composite pattern"; a container
that can hold ISOFields of many kinds as well as other [nested] ISOMsgs.

This example shows how to create an ISOMsg, populate it, clone it,
set/unset fields on clone, merge it, etc.

Remember you don't have to deal with bitmaps, ISOPackager takes
care of that dirty task.

It's supposed to be self explained so have a look at Test.java.
