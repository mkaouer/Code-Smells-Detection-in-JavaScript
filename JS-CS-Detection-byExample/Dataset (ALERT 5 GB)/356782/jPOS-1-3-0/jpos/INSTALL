Starting at release 1.2 jPOS drops GNUmake support and builds 
using Ant (http://jakarta.apache.org).

We currently distribute 2 modules: 'main' and 'ext'.

While 'main' module's classes are self contained, 'ext' module
requires external classes (to be installed at jpos/ext directory)

Currently the required jars are:

   mail.jar and activation.jar (available from Sun)
   sun-util.jar (from Jini1.1 distro)
   comm.jar   (available from Sun)
   xalan.jar  (http://xml.apache.org)
   xerces.jar (http://xml.apache.org)

'ext' module implements just 'ReliableSequencer' and 'OperatorLogListener'
at the moment but the idea is that 'ext' module will contains classes
that fit within org.jpos package structure _but_ requires some kind
of external non-distributable jar file.

Running build (build.sh on Unix, build.bat on Windows) will show
the available targets:

Examples:

   build main javadoc : builds main and javadoc on a Windows machine
   ./build.sh ext doc : builds main, ext, extdoc and doc

This is work in progress, feel free to ask. We run a developers
mailing list at jpos-dev@onelist.com (jpos-dev-subscribe@onelist.com)
