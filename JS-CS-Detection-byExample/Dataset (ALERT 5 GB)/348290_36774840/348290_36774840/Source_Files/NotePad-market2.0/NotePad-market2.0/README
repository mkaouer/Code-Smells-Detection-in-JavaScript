A Notes app based on the Google Sample project available in the SDK.

I wanted a couple of stuff which wasn't available in the original sample (which someone put on the market and I downloaded.)

1. Share functionality.
2. Dark background (sample uses light theme for editing)
3. Holo theme (app I was using was an earlier version built for pre-Honeycomb)
4. Change the way the posts got their title. Now it is the first line in the file, always.
5. Get rid of the stupid lines in the editor. Don't mimic reality, make it better! (e.g. no lines)
