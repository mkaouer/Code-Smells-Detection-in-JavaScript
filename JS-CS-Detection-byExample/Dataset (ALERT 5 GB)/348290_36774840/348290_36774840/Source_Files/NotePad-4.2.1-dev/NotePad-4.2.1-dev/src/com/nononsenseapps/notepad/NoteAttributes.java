 * ignored and will terminate the parsing.

 * These are the attributes so far: [locked] - indicates that the note requires
 * verification by password to be opened.

 * [r:12:00] - short hand for a reminder set on the same date as the due date
 * [r:31.01.12 20:00] - defines a reminder 31st january 2012 at 8PM.
