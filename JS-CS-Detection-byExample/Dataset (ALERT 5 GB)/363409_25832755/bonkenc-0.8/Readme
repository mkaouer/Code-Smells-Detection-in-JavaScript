BonkEnc version 0.8

BonkEnc is an encoder for various audio formats. It can
produce MP3, Ogg Vorbis, BONK, AAC and VQF files.

BonkEnc uses Albert L. Fabers CDRip DLL for audio ripping.

The new command line interface is accessible by invoking
BonkEnc with the '--console' parameter.

Requirements
------------

	- Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/SE/ME
	- A 200MHz processor or better for playing BONK files
	- Winamp is required to play BONK files in Windows
	- You'll need properly installed ASPI drivers for CD ripping.

	Additional requirements for compiling the sources:

		- MinGW32 v1.0 or greater (http://www.mingw.org/)
		- smooth v0.8.60.0 (http://www.smooth-project.org/)
		- IOLib v5.x (http://www.iolib.org/ - included with smooth)

	Additional optional software:

		- BladeEnc is used if installed (http://bladeenc.mp3.no)
		- FAAC is used if installed (http://faac.sf.net)
		- TwinVQ is used if installed (http://www.twinvq.org)

Problems
--------

	- There are the following restrictions on the input file format:

		- BonkEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit
		- BladeEnc:
				- files must be 16 bit at 32, 44.1 or 48kHz
		- LAME:
				- files must be 16 bit at standard rates (8, 11.025, 12, 16, 22.05, 24, 32, 44.1, 48kHz)
		- Ogg Vorbis:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- FAAC:
				- files must be 16 bit, stereo
		- TwinVQ:
				- files must be 16 bit, at 22.05kHz (24 and 32kBit) or 44.1kHz (48kBit)

	- Resampling is only supported with LAME. Input files must be at the desired output
	  sampling rate unless you are encoding with LAME.

	- The command line interface doesn't support options for modifying encoder settings, yet.

Future plans
------------

	- extend the BONK format to support ID3V2 tags
	- extract artist and title from the filename
	- input filters for AAC, VQF
	- support more audio formats (FLAC, MAC, ...)
	- allow expert settings for LAME (ATH, Temporal Masking, Psy-Models)
	- develop an IOLib-Filters based plugin system
	- support more languages
	- cleanup the code
	- finish CDDB support
	- allow command line options to configure encoder settings
	- write online documentation for BonkEnc
