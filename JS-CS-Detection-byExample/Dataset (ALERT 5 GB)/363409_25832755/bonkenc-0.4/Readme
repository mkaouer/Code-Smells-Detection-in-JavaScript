BonkEnc version 0.4

BonkEnc is an encoder for the new BONK audio format. BONK offers better sound
quality at lower bit rates than MP3. BonkEnc can also encode MP3 files if you
have the BladeEnc DLL installed (http://bladeenc.mp3.no).

Requirements:

- Windows NT/2000/XP, Windows 95/98/SE/ME
- A 200MHz processor or better for playing BONK files
- Winamp is required to play BONK files in Windows

Requirements for compiling the sources:

- MinGW32 v1.0 (http://mingw.sf.net)
- SMOOTH v0.8.55.0 (http://smooth.sf.net)

Problems:

- The current version of Paul Harrison's BONK encoder still has a few bugs.
  Please contact him (pfh@csse.monash.edu.au) if BonkEnc generates BONK files with errors.

- BonkEnc can use 44.1 kHz, 16 bit wave files only. Don't try to use another format for input.
