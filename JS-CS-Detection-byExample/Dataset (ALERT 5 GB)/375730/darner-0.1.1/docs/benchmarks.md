# Resident Memory

How much memory does the queue server use?  We are testing both steady-state memory resident, and also how aggressively
the server acquires and releases memory as queues expand and contract.  We tuned Kestrel's JVM down to the smallest
heap that didn't cause OOM's and didn't impact performance: `-Xmx256m -Xms256m`.

# Queue Flooding

How quickly can we flood items through an empty queue?  This tests the raw throughput of the server.  We also include
memcache as an upper bound - a throughput at which we are likely saturating on `send/recv` syscalls.  We had to stop the
kestrel benchmark at 300 concurrent connections - anything higher caused connection errors and timeouts.

# Fairness

How does the queue server deal with messages of varying sizes?  This benchmark pushes large messages through the queue
in order to see whether they cause latency spikes for smaller requests, which can lead to timeouts.  For the graph
below, a flatter curve means each request is more fairly served in time.

# Queue Packing

This tests the queue server's behavior with a backlog of items.  The challenge for the queue server is to serve items
that no longer all fit in memory.  Absolute throughput isn't important here - item sizes are large to quickly saturate
free memory.  Instead it's important for the throughput to flatten out as the backlog grows.
