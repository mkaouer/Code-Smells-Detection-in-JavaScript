  QuickFIX comes with two example application. One sell side and one buy side. These application
  are in the <B>quickfix/examples</B> directory. These applications are not meant to demonstrate
  good application design or meant to be used in a real production system. They are merely provided
  as a tutorial on how to build an application with QuickFIX.
  <p>
  <p>
  The applications provided are <B>ordermatch</B> which is a server that will match and execute limit
  orders, and <B>tradeclient</B> which is a ridiculous console based trading client, but it did
  certify with the <a href="http://www.tradearca.com">Archipelago</a> Exhcange and ECN for FIX 4.1 and 4.2.
  </p>
  <p>
  Please study these examples to see a complete although minimal implementation of a FIX application.
