  Microsoft Visual Studio's Statement completion options do not play very well with C++ templates.
  You can resolve this issues simply by turning this feature off. Do this by going to the
  <B>Tools->Options</B> menu. Under the <B>Editor</B> tab, uncheck all the <B>Statement completion
  options</B>.

  <A NAME="B2"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">When building QuickFIX with gcc, the compiler complains it cannot find &lt;sstream&gt;</FONT></B><br>
  Some earlier versions of gcc were not supplied with the sstream include file. You can get it
  <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/libstdc++/2000-q2/msg00700/sstream">here</a>

  <br><br>

  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">Under Visual Studio .NET, my build fails during the custom build step.</FONT></B><br>
  For some reason Visual Studio .NET reacts differently to errors in the custom build step then
  MSDEV 6.0. The easiest fix is to simply copy all the header files from your <I>quickfix/src/C++</I>
  directory to your <I>quickfix/include</I> directory. The build should be succesful on your next attempt.

  <A NAME="B4"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">After running <I>./configure</I> on *nix, the test checking for recursive mutex fails.</FONT></B><br>
  Older versions of QuickFIX relied on the presence of recursive mutexes for synchronization. Some versions
  of some unices may not support these. One example would be Solaris 2.6.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="B5"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">After running <I>make</I> on *nix, I get an error that says <I>libtool: ltconfig version `' does not match ltmain.sh version `1.3.5'</I></FONT></B><br>
  Run the <I>./bootstrap</I> script, then run <I>./configure</I> and <I>make</I> again.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="B6"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">During compilation, the compiler has errors in MessageValidator.cpp pertaining to the xml code.</FONT></B><br>
  Older versions of QuickFIX did not search for libxml in the configure script. Check to make sure that libxml is installed
  and that the correct include and library directories are being passed into the compiler.  You may have to
  modify the configure.in file to do this.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="B7"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">When I try to compile my application, it complains PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE is not defined.</FONT></B><br>
  On some systems, you need to define _XOPEN_SOURCE as 500 in order to use recursive mutexes.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="B8"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">Can I build quickfix on *nix with a compiler other than gcc?</FONT></B><br>
  Probably. We have been able to compile it with icc as well. You can always verify your compilation
  by running the suite of unit and acceptance tests against your build.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="B9"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">The <I>./configure</I> script fails or make fails.</FONT></B><br>
  Run the <I>./bootstrap</I> script, then run <I>./configure</I> and <I>make</I> again.

  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">When trying to connect to a FIX engine running on another machine, QuickFIX immediately drops the connection when it receives a logon.</FONT></B><br>
  Chances are the clocks on the machines are not synchronized. Either synchronize the clocks
  or use the CheckLatency and MaxLatency settings to allow the processing of older messages.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="R2"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">QuickFIX seems very unstable on a multiprocessor machine.</FONT></B><br>
  If you are using gcc 2.95.x, you need to use another STL library like
  <a href="http://www.stlport.org/download.html">STLport</a>

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="R3"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">When running my application under *nix, it crashes with a segmentation fault.</FONT></B><br>
  Make sure you have exceptions enabled with the <I>-fexceptions</I> flag. Also make sure you
  are catching any exceptions which need to be handled. QuickFIX does make use of the <I>throw</I>
  specifier in all function definitions which throw exceptions. If you are still having problems,
  verify that you are using the latest stable release of gcc. Some earlier versions have severe bugs
  with exception handling.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="R4"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">When running my application under Linux, it crashes with a SIG_ABRT.</FONT></B><br>
  Linux will always crash with a SIG_ABRT if an exception is thrown from a shared library. Under Linux
  you cannot link QuickFIX dynamically, nor can you use it inside a dynamically loaded code segment.
  QuickFIX must be linked statically into your application. We are currently investigating possible
  workarounds for this.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="R4"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">Use of MySQL code under Java results in a <I>UnsatisfiedLinkError</I>.</FONT></B><br>
  You havn't built quickfix or the JNI wrapper with MySQL support.  See the installation instructions for building
  with MySQL on your system.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="R5"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">My QuickFIX application crashed immediately on startup when using a DataDictionary.</FONT></B><br>
  Older versions of QuickFIX crash if the DataDictionary is poorly formed XML.  Check for errors
  in your data dictionary.  This was fixed in 1.6.

  <br><br>
  <A NAME="R6"/>
  <B><FONT color="#FF0000">QuickFIX is dropping messages with repeating groups when not using a DataDictionary.</FONT></B><br>
  Older versions of QuickFIX could not tell the difference between garbled messages and 
  these messages.  Make sure you are using a DataDictionary if you intend on receiving
  repeating groups.  Newer versions will accept these messages and send proper rejects.
