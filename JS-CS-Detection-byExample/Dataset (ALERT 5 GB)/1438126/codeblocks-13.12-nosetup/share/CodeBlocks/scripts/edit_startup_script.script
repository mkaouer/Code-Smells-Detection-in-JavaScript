//
// Sample script that opens the "startup.script" file for editing
// (check startup.script which registers this script under the menu "Settings->Edit startup script")
//



// In order to open the startup.script file, we first have to locate it.
// Code::Blocks looks for scripts in two places:
//  1) the per-user scripts dir
//  2) the global scripts dir
//
// One way to achieve this is to use the following lines:
//
//  // search for "startup.script" in scripts folders (user and global)
//  local f = LocateDataFile(_T("startup.script"), sdScriptsUser | sdScriptsGlobal);
//
// LocateDataFile() looks in the specified dirs for the file in question.
// Per-user directories *always* have precedence in this function so if the file
// exists both in the global dirs as well as in the user directory, the file in
// the user directory will be returned.
//
// In this sample script though, we 'll follow a different procedure. We will manually
// ask for the user scripts dir and try to open the file there. If it is not opened
// (which means it doesn't exist), we will copy the script from the global scripts dir
// and then attempt to open it again.
// This will make sure that the startup.script to edit is the one the user used to use
// until the moment this script runs.



// get user scripts dir
local scriptsDir = GetFolder(sdScriptsUser);

// try to open it in the editor
local ed = GetEditorManager().Open(scriptsDir + _T("/startup.script"));

// if it succeeded, we 're done here
if (!IsNull(ed))
    return;

// log a message
LogDebug(_T("First time editing startup.script: copying from global to user scripts dir"));

// nope, we must copy the global script
local scriptsGlobalDir = GetFolder(sdScriptsGlobal);

// don't try to copy over itself (in case something's wrong)
if (scriptsGlobalDir == scriptsDir)
    return;
IO.CopyFile(scriptsGlobalDir + _T("/startup.script"), // source file
            scriptsDir + _T("/startup.script"), // destination file
            false); // don't overwrite (well, we know it's not there but better safe than sorry)

// and try again to open it in the editor
ed = GetEditorManager().Open(scriptsDir + _T("/startup.script"));

// we don't check anything more because the user's system is too borked to bother :)
// just display a message if all our efforts have failed
if (IsNull(ed))
    ShowError(_T("Could not locate startup.script anywhere on this system..."));
