Hayward	2013-08-08	Wow! Thank you so much for this program. I had a large collection of tv shows which I was not looking forward to sorting out. Dumped the files into FileBot and within minutes, all done.Even finds the correct name within filenames with a load of junk in them.
Raydan	2013-09-08	I can really recommend using filebot for sorting, moving, deleting, subtitle searching... I just started the script once... and it was quite mindblowing to be honest.
Nitish Kumar	2013-09-21	FileBot is such an amazing piece of work. Been using it for TV Show renaming but today I tried it on movies as well. Big time success!

Sic	2014-03-07	I am a heavy XBMC user and I have tested many renaming programs and I have to admit yours just rocks. I virtually have 100% success rate in scraping.
Chuck	2014-04-08	It will rip through movies and tv series files like a knife through butter.
Piers	2014-04-16	I would go with FileBot to rename content - over 18,000 files and a 99.8% first time success rate.
Joe Cal	2014-07-31	Filebot is probably one of the top 5 computer programs I've ever used.

Resonance	2015-06-12	Filebot renamed seasons worth of episodes in just a second, exactly the way I needed it for Plex Media Server. The design and execution of this software is excellent. If you are using Plex, or thinking about buying Plex, you absolutely must have this software.
digitaladdictions	2015-08-31	Worth every penny and then some! I can't even start to fathom how much time and mind numbing tedium FileBot has saved me.
Barry	2015-11-06	Filebot is the best software out there. For organizing TV Shows it is indispensable as far as I am concerned. I don't know what more I can say except that is simple to use and works every time.
Frankie CzechMate	2015-12-20	Absolute miracle! I cannot recommend it enough. It made renaming and organizing more than 10.000 files a breeze!
Brandoneous	2016-02-05	Fantastic application - Shut up and take my money!
