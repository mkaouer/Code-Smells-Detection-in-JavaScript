Milos Kaurin;2012-04-14;One of the best (if not the best) multiplatform episode renamer/subtitle downloader
Gillardino Boccacio;2012-05-12;indispensable tool for people with a large library of videos. Through this program, I was able to restore order in films and serials. Thank you!
Ed Doran;2012-08-25;A must use tool. Really simplifies watching my favorite movies
Kate Smith;2012-11-05;awesome user-interface!
OpenID User;2012-11-05;Extremely quick and efficient. Great for renaming anime, too - I was very impressed at Filebot's ability to consistently rename anime using AniDB. A must for keeping a large collection clean!
akya;2013-02-21;Extremely efficient.. especially for renaming single episodes.
hfurius;2013-02-24;easy to use and easy to work. thanks a lot!

Bobby Scholtens;2013-05-27;"Pretty awesome piece of software. Very fast and easy to use. As it states: ""it just works""."
williamdanis;2013-06-18;Filebot is excellent! Thanks.
haywardb;2013-08-08;Wow, thank you so much for this program. I had a large collection of tv shows which I was not looking forward to sorting out. Dumped the files into FileBot and within minutes, all done. Even finds correct name within filenames with a load of junk in them.
Raydan;2013-09-08;I can really recommend using filebot for sorting, moving, deleting, subtitle searching... I just started the script once... and it was quite mindblowing to be honest.
Nitish Kumar;2013-09-21;FileBot is such an amazing piece of work. Been using it for TV Shows renaming but today tried over movies as well. Big time success!
mitchfranklin;2013-11-17;Absolutely brilliant application. Does everything so smoothly!
Alexander Walter;2013-12-12;Loving FileBot. I only wish I had discovered it sooner. Thank you for saving me so much time.
Saul Chernick;2013-12-25;This is an amazing, amazing open-source project and deserves much success.
shareiscare;2014-03-07;I am a heavy XBMC user and I have tested many renaming programs and I have to admit your one just rocks. I virtually have 100% success rate in scraping.
chuckl;2014-04-08;It will rip through movies and tv series files like a knife through butter.
Piers;2014-04-16;I would go with FileBot as a free and simple way to rename content - over 18,000 files and a 99.8% first time success rate.
thejoecal;2014-07-31;Filebot is probably one of the top 5 computer programs I've ever used.
IvoryBrony;2014-09-01;Seriously one of the most useful apps on my Mac.
Jeff Racer;2015-02-11;This app has saved me thousands of hours.
Christian Horch;2015-04-14;This is a new level and the ease of use is amazing!!!
