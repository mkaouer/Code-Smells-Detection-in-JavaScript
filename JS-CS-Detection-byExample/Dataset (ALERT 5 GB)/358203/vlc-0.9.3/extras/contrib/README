This is the contrib build system for VLC Media Player. It has been
primarily developed for Mac, it has been adapted for BeOs and win32.
It would be not too difficult to extend it to other sytem.

To use it, first in the contrib directory, type :
	./bootstrap

You can specify an argument to cross compile, for example:
    ./bootstrap i586-pc-beos
This will look for a i586-pc-beos-gcc cross compiler. Default is to
build natively.

Bootstrap generates your default contrib configuration and puts it in a file
named 'distro.mak'. Edit this file to fine-tune your preferences for 3rd-party
libraries that will be build in the contrib system.

Customize config.mak if you need to, then you need to choose between
building from source (can take a long time but is easily customizable)
and fetching a pre-compiled binary package. Either type 'make src'
or 'make bin' (also from the contrib directory).

Once the contribs are built, you can start building VLC.
See: http://developers.videolan.org/vlc/osx-compile.html 
or INSTALL.win32 for more details on that.

Happy hacking.

Appendix: 
 I) BUILDING AMR SUPPORT IN FFMPEG

To build ffmpeg with AMR support add HAVE_AMR=1 to config.mak or do:

echo "HAVE_AMR=1" >> config.mak

and add .libamrwb .libamrnb (before .ffmpeg) to your distro.mak. Then rebuild the contrib with: 

make src
