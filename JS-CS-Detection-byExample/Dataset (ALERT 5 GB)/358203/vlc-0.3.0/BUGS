   For information on how to post a useful bug report, please read
doc/bugreport-howto.txt.


Core:

  * vlc_cond_broadcast unimplemented on most plaforms.


Input:

  * DVD raw device support doesn't seem to work.

  * HTTP input seems to lose packets during pre-parsing.

  * TS input doesn't work under Windows 98 when the server address is
  specified.

  * Stopping and playing again a network stream often makes vlc crash
  under Windows.


Audio output:

  * Audio output stutters on some audio cards. For instance kwyxz's SB
  128 with an es1371 chip.


Video output:

  * We don't render subtitles on RGB surfaces.

  * The QNX video output plugin is broken because of vout4.

  * The MGA video output plugin makes the picture stutter when
  MGA_NUM_FRAMES is set to a value higher than 1.

  * The SPU decoder doesn't detect when the video output failed to
  launch itself, and we segfault.

  * On-the-fly resizing doesn't work when using a chroma transformation.


Chroma transformations:

  * Most chroma transformation modules completely ignore margins.

  * Most chroma transformation modules restrict the width of a picture
  to multiples of 8 or even 16. We can achieve better than that.


Filters:

  * Most filters completely ignore margins.


Gtk interface:

  * Playing like a madman with the `Playlist' button makes the interface
  crash.


Misc:

  * The Jin-Roh DVD seems to segfault.
