  <heading>What is VideoLAN ?</heading>
  <p>
   VideoLAN is a project of sudents of the École Centrale Paris which aims 
   to broadcast video on the campus, and provide the students with a MPEG2 
   software-only decoder. VideoLAN is an OpenSource project which will thus 
   allow anyone to watch DVD movies under Linux, BeOS, MacOS and most Unix 
   systems
  </p>
  <p>
    You may want to look at the port section on our website : 
    <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org" name="http://www.videolan.org/">.

  <heading>What is the vlc</heading>
  <p>
   Vlc stands for VideoLAN client. It is the name of the program which is
   capable of decoding MPEG streams, and displaying them onto your screen,
   so you can watch you favourite movies, confortably sit in your armchair
   :-).

 <heading>Installing the vlc : the packages</heading>
  <p>
   This is certainly the simplest way to intsall the vlc on your system,
   especially if you're using a packaged OS.
  </p>

  <p>
   The first thing to do is to get an archive, on our web site 
   <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/download.html" name="http://www.videolan.org/download.html">
  </p>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Linux/Unix users</heading>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Which package to chose ?</heading>
   <p>
    There are different packages because vlc has "plugins" which provide 
    features but also enlarge the executable and require external libs. 
   </p>
   <p>
    SDL is a lib which allows you to have an accelerated video output.
    You will need libsdl > 1.1.6
   </p>
   <p>
    If you're using the enlightened sound daemon, you may want to try 
    the esd-aware vlc.
   </p>
   <p>
    Generally, when you don't know what a module name is, you don't 
    need/use it :-)
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
   <heading>Binary archive</heading>
   <p>
    Untar it typing
    <verb>
     tar xvzf vlc-x.x.x.tar.gz
    </verb>
     Go in the vlc directory and get to the 'How to play movies' section If
     you wish not to keep vlc in this single directory but install it fully
     on your system, you may, as root, type
    <verb>
     make install
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
   
  <sect2>
   <heading>Debian package</heading>
   <p>
    Just use dpkg :
    <verb>
     dpkg -i vlc-x.x.x.deb
    </verb>
   </p>
   <p>
    Depending on the package you have downloaded, you may have dependency
    problems. You have to solve them, by installing the required libs.
   </p>
  </sect2>
   
  <sect2>
    <heading>RPM package</heading>
   <p>
    Install vlc just as you would install any rpm package : 
    <verb>
     rpm -i vlc-x.x.x.rpm
    </verb>
   </p>
   <p>
    You may have to install external libs to meet dependencies, depending on
    the package you downloaded (gnome, gtk, esd, ...).
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <heading>BeOS users</heading>
  <p>
   Double-click on the archive. It should open your favorite archive extracter.
   You can then execute the vlc from there, or extract the archive to a 
   diretory and run it from there.

 <heading>Using the vlc</heading>
 <p>
  Good job, you have installed the vlc on your system. Now, it's time to 
  use it. Don't worry, it's not that difficult.
 </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Lauching</heading>
  <sect2>
   <heading>The graphical interface</heading>
   <p>
    Basically, double clicking on the vlc icon, or typing 'vlc' in a 
    console should launch a graphical interface On Linux/Unix, you may want
    to specify gnome or gtk interface, with the "--intf" option.
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>In case it doesn't work</heading>
   <p>
    In case this does not work, you'll have to use command line options.
    Usually, to play a file, you'll use :
    <verb>
     vlc [file name]
    </verb>
    To play a dvd, if your dvd device is "/dev/dvd", you'll type :
    <verb>
     vlc dvd:/dev/dvd
    </verb>
   </sect2>  
   <sect2>
    <heading>What is this DVD device you keep talking about</heading>
    <p>
     This is a file which is "linked" somehow to your dvd device.
    </p>
    <sect3>
     <heading>Linux users</heading>
     <p>
      Usually, you dvd device is /dev/hd? (if you have an ide drive).
      For instance, if you DVD player is master on the second IDE device,
      it will be /dev/hdc.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is very useful to create a symlink to this file, called /dev/dvd. 
      To do this, as root, type (if your dvd device is /dev/hdc for example) :
      <verb>
       ln -s /dev/hdc /dev/dvd
      </verb>
      Also make sure you have read AND write permission to the device 
      (otherwise dvd decryption won't work).
     </p>
    </sect3>
    <sect3>
     <heading>BeOS users</heading>
     <p>
       Under BeOS, the dvd device looks like 
       "/dev/disk/ide/atapi/1/slave/0/raw" for example, if your dvd device is 
       slave on your first (not sure) ide device.

 <sect1>
  <heading>Using the interface</heading>
  <p>
   By now you should see a beautiful interface, with buttons and menus.
   The text should be quite self-explaining : "Open file", "Open Disc", ...
  </p>
  <p>
   For Dvd's you can choose directly from the "open" box the title & chapter 
   you want to play.
  </p>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Fullscreen - chapters - features</heading>
  <p>
   Some of the following features don't work yet on some platforms.
   We're doing our best to get the ports in sync.
  </p>
  <p>
   At any time you can change the audio/subtitles channel using either the 
   "setting" menu from the interface or using the "right click" menu from
   the video output window.
  </p>
  <p>
   To change chapter, you can use the right-click menu or the interface. 
   Please note that the gnome interface is more advanced than the gtk or 
   qt ones.
  </p>
  <p>
   Using the 'f' key when using SDL or XVideo output toggles the 
   fullscreen mode. Be warned that "right click" menus are a bit 
   unstable.
  </p>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <heading>User help</heading>
  <p>
   First of all, it something seems to go wrong, read and try try to 
   understand the error messages. If you are a confirmed user, you 
   may try the "-vvv" option which makes the vlc very verbose.
  </p>
  <p>
   There is a FAQ page on our website :

 <sect1>
  <heading>Command line options</heading>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Choosing the video output</heading>
   <p>
    You have to use the "-V" otpion. For example :
    <verb>
     vlc -V xvideo
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
   <heading>Choosing the audio output</heading>
   <p>
    Use the "-A" option. For example :
    <verb>
     vlc -A alsa
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
   <heading>Specifying a file</heading>
   <p>
    Simply put the file name at the end of the command line, you won't need then 
    to click "open" when the interface launches :
    <verb>
     vlc myfile.mpeg
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
   <heading>Specifying the title and chapter where to start</heading>
   <p>
    Use the "-t" and "-T" to specify title and chapter. For example, to go to the 12th 
    chapter of the 2nd title, you'll type :
    <verb>
     vlc -t 2 -T 12
    </verb>

 <heading>For real men : building your vlc :-)</heading>
 <p>
  You can choose either to take the latest release, or a CVS source. Note that
  CVS snapshots may be broken, although we do our best to prevent this from
  happening.
 </p>
 <p>
  From here, you have to be a little experienced, even more if you want to use
  the cvs.
 </p>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Getting an archive</heading>
  <p>
   You have guessed it, the first thing to do is to get the source.
   Until there, everyone should understand :)
  </p>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Web site</heading>
   <p>
    Source packages can be found in the "tarballs" section of the download page :
    <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/download.html" name="http://www.videolan.org/dowload.html">.
   </p>
   <p>
    CVS snapshots are available from the address : 
    <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/packages/snapshots/" 
    name="http://www.videolan.org/packages/snapshots/">.
   </p>
   <p>
    Then untar the archive :
    <verb>
     tar xzf vlc-x-x-x.tar.gz
    </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
  <sect2>
   <heading>Directly from CVS</heading>
   <p>
    Firs log in as suer anonymous with an empty password :
    <verb>
     cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan login
    </verb>
   Then retrieve the repository :
   <verb>
    cvs -d :pserver:anonymous@anoncvs.videolan.org:/var/cvs/videolan -z3 checkout vlc
   </verb>
   </p>
  </sect2>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Building the program</heading>
  <p>
   Go into the vlc directory and run the configure script :
   <verb>
    ./configure
   </verb>
   If you want to enable options, you may add "--enable-option" to the previous line.
   For example, to build with the xvideo extension, and alsa support, you should type :
   <verb>
    ./configure --enable-xvideo --enable-alsa
   </verb>
   To get the list of the available options, and know if they are enabled by default,
   you can try :
   <verb>
    ./configure --help
   </verb>
   A very typical installation, on a XFree 4.1 system, recent video card, with gnome, is :
   <verb>
    ./configure --enable-xvideo --enable-esd --enable-gnome
   </verb>
  <p>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Plugins, builtins ...</heading>
  <p>
   The configure script should create a Makefile.opts file, which you can edit and modify.
   Indeed you can chose to have features (as esd support, for example) built as plugins
   or inside the program.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you build a feature as a plugin, it can lead to a little loss of performance.
   It you build it inside the code, i'll enlarge a bit the size of the executable.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you're done with Makefile.opts (which also works if you leave it untouched), just 
   type:
    <verb>
    make
    </verb>
   It should compile without any error. If there are, please check you have the required libs 
   installed on your system, as the configure script can't check them all.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you're done with it, as root, type :
   <verb>
    make install
   </verb>
  if you wish to have vlc fully installed on your system. If you prefer to keep in in the 
  current directory, you may skip the "make install". You'll then have to cd into the vlc 
  directory and type "./vlc" instead of just typing vlc.
  </p>
 </sect1>
</sect>

<sect>
 <heading>Really advanced use</heading>
 <sect1>
  <heading>Using the videolan network solution</heading>
  <p>
   I'll only speak about the vlc here. There will be a howto on the whole network solution.
   You have to tell the vlc that it will receive network streams. This can be done either by
   using the "network" button of the interface, or in the command line : 
   <verb>
    vlc ts://server[:port]
   </verb>
  </p>
  <p>
   This works for unicast. If you are receiving a broadcasted stream, you have to specify the 
   broadcast address : 
   <verb>
    vlc --broadcast broadcast_addr ts://server[:port]
   </verb>
  </p>
