  Bug report  HOWTO
 - - - - - - - - - -

 * General rules

   - Be sure the problem you are reporting is not already known, or
  maybe even already solved. Source of information include the BUGS
  file, the mailing-list archives at http://www.via.ecp.fr/ml/videolan/
  and your old friend Google.

   - Be sure to be using a recent version. Bug reports against old
  versions of vlc are likely to be ignored, because changes in the
  program may make it impossible to reproduce the bug, or may even have
  fixed it.

   - Give as many details as possible about your problem! Better too
  much than not enough.

   - Don't forget to say which version of vlc you are using (0.2.91,
  CVS snapshot from 21 Dec 2001, Debian packages 0.2.92-4). It is
  important to tell us where you got the packages from (web site, CVS,
  distribution).

   - Also, your platform is very important. vlc runs on a lot of
  different operating systems, so you should at least provide your
  operating system name and version (Windows 98, Debian Linux woody,
  BeOS, ...) and your CPU (Pentium 3, Sparc, PowerPC, ...).


 * Reporting a ./configure or make issue

   - Give the full log showing the problem:
      ./configure <options> > logfile.txt 2>&1
      make 2>&1 > logfile.txt 2>&1

   - When dealing with a ./configure issue, please provide the generated
  config.log file.

   - Your compiler brand and version may be relevant here as well.


 * Reporting a crash

   - Try to reproduce the crash and to explain how you reproduced it.

   - A gdb backtrace can be useful. For it to have any meaning, vlc
  should have been compiled with debug symbols (add the --enable-debug
  flag to ./configure)


 * Where to send bug reports?

   - The vlc-devel mailing-list is probably the best place to send your
  bug report, just email it to <vlc-devel@videolan.org>. If you are
  concerned by the size of the attached files, you can put them on a
  website and post their address instead.
