 * mtime.h: high resolution time management functions
 * This header provides portable high precision time management functions,
 * which should be the only ones used in other segments of the program, since
 * functions like gettimeofday() and ftime() are not always supported.
 * Most functions are declared as inline or as macros since they are only
 * interfaces to system calls and have to be called frequently.
 * 'm' stands for 'micro', since maximum resolution is the microsecond.
 * Functions prototyped are implemented in interface/mtime.c.
