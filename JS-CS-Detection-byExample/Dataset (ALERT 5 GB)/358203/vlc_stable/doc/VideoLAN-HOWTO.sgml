  <heading>What is VideoLAN ?</heading>
  <p>
    VideoLAN is a project of sudent of  the École Centrale Paris which aims 
    to broadcast video on the campus, and provide the students with a MPEG2 
    software-only decoder. VideoLAN is an OpenSource project which will thus 
    allow anyone to watch DVD movies under Linux, FreeBSD, BeOS and certainly 
    other OS.
  </p>
  <p>
  For the time being, the network components are not released.

  <heading>Disclaimer</heading>
  <p>
  This documentation is given "as is", and any comment and improvement are welcome.
  </p>

  <p>
  In this HOWTO, we consider you already have a little knowledge about Linux, and you 
  know how to use a DVD. If not, good howto can be found on the Linux Documentation
  Projet.

 <heading>How to install the VideoLAN Client</heading>

  <p>
   First, get an archive, on our web site <htmlurl url="http://www.videolan.org/downloads.html" name="http://www.videolan.org/downloads.html">
  </p>
  
  <sect1>
   <heading>Binary archive</heading>
  <p>
  Untar it typing
  <verb>
   tar xvzf vlc-x.x.x.tar.gz
  </verb>
  Go in the vlc directory and get to the 'How to play streams' section
  </p>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
   <heading>Debian package</heading>
  <p>
  Just use dpkg :
   <verb>
   dpkg -i vlc-x.x.x.deb
   </verb>
  </p>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
   <heading>RPM package</heading>
  <p>
  RPM pacakges are not available yet.
  </p>
  </sect1>
  
  <sect1>
   <heading>Source archive</heading>
  <p>
   Uncompress it typing
   <verb>
    tar xvzf vlc-src-x.x.x.tar.gz
   </verb>
   then run the <tt>configure script</tt> typing
   <verb>
    ./configure
   </verb>
   </p>
   <p>
   You can include more feature, as a MMX support or a frame buffer output :
   You just have to type :
   <verb>
    ./configure --enable-feature --enable-other_feature
   </verb>
   where to following feature are available : 
   fb (for frame buffer),gnome,mmx (MMX optiomisations - Recomended ),
   ppro (for 6th generation processors, such as Athlon, PII ....), 
   sdl (great perforamances), x11, esd, oss, alsa, and some advanced options.
   </p>
   <p>
   The default <tt>./configure</tt> script is in fact <tt>./configure --enable-ppro --enable-mmx --enable-x11 --enable-oss</tt>
   </p>
   <p>
   So, the tipical configuration (for i386 computers) is :
   <verb>
   ./configure
   </verb>
   </p>
   <p>
   Then, build the VideoLAN client typing :
    <verb>
     make
    </verb>
   this can takes several minutes. Do not use source archives unless you
    have a powerful computer ....
  </p>
  <p>
  Finally, as root, type
  <verb>
  make install
  </verb>
  </p>

 <heading>How to Play movies, using the VideoLAN client</heading>
 <sect1>
  <heading>How to launch the client</heading>
  
  <p>
   The general syntax is : <tt>vlc [options] file1 file2 .....</tt> or <tt>vlc [options] -</tt> to read 
   from standard input
  </p>
 </sect1>
 <sect1>
 <heading>Usage</heading>
  <p>
  Generally, you'll use the VideoLAN client under X.
  Currently, 8,15,16 and 32 bpp are supported with XFree 3.6 and 16, 24 and 32  bpp with XFree 4.0
  </p>
  <p>
  While playing a movie, place your mouse on the main window, type 'i', you'll 
  find the main commands.
  </p>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
  <heading>Where to find the vob files ....</heading>
  <p>
  We consider that you know how to support DVD in your kernel (included 2.2.16 and later versions with your
  CDrom support, check    <htmlurl name="http://www.kernel.dk/" url="http://www.kernel.dk" > for 2.2.14 kernels ).
  If you mount your dvd device, go to mount_point/video_ts , i'll find many 
  files, including vts_0?_?.vob files.
  </p>
  <p>
  A movie is generally situated on 4 to 7 vob files ... often from vts_01_1.vob 
  to vts_01_6.vob for example, but sometimes, it is situated on the vts_02 serie, 
  or on any other serie.
  </p>
 </sect1>

 <sect1>
  <heading>From a DVD</heading>
  <p>
   For unencrypted DVD, you only have to put the list of VOB files to read.
   For example :
   <verb>
   vlc /dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_[12345].VOB
   </verb>
  </p>

  <p>
   If you intend to read encrypted DVD and you have DeCSS, first read DeCSS documentation, 
   then you'll be able to use this type of command :
   <verb>
   cat /dvd/VIDEO_TS/VTS_01_[12345].VOB | css-cat -vaP - | vlc -
   </verb>
   Don't forget the "-" to read from standard input
  </p>
 </sect1>
 
 <sect1>
 <heading>Audio and subtitles options</heading>
 <p>
 You can specify the audio channel you would like to listen to, and if you wish 
 to see subtitles (a little buggy for the moment).
 </p>
 <p>
 The options are : 
 <verb>
 -a [ac3|mpeg|lpcm|off] : audio type (default is ac3, as most DVD user ac3)
 -c [0..16] : audio channel (default is 0)
 -s [0..32] : subtitles (default is 0)
 </verb>
 </p>

 <heading>The user interface and the plugins</heading>
  <sect2>
  <heading>X11 interface</heading>
   <p>
    Right mouse button toggles help mode.
    Middle mouse button toggles cursor.
    Press "i" to get perfomance values.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
  <heading>The SDL Plugin</heading>
  <p>
  Thanks to this plugin, the YUV can be done by the hardware, and display 
  uses overlay. The performance increase is huge ! We have managed to play
  a DVD stream at its full framerate on an athlon 500 with 25% idle CPU.
  </p>
  <p>
  To use it you need a <bf>very</bf> recent version of libsdl and libsdl-dev 
  ( at least 1.6-2 ), and a very recent XFree 4.
  </p>
  <p>
  Build the vlc after configuring with the <tt>--enable-sdl</tt> option. 
  Then play a stream. At the begining, it's not hard-accelerated. Press 'y' 
  on the interface, if <tt>[YUV acceleration] : 1,</tt> is displayed on 
  you console, you are in accelerated YUV + overlay. You may use 'y' to 
  toggle mode ( tough it may remain a bit buggy for the time being ).
  If <tt>[YUV acceleration] : 0,</tt>, either you are using a too old 
  version of SDL, or XFree 4, or maybe you video card isn't supported.
  </p>
  <p>
  The SDL plugin is know to segfault when exiting. We think it may come from
  the libSDL, not from the vlc, although we aren't sure yet.
  </p>
  </sect2>
  
  <sect2>
  <heading>Frame buffer interface</heading>
   <p>
   To select this, lauch the vlc with the <tt>--vout fb</tt> option.
   </p>
   <p>
    Space bar toggles help mode.
    Press "i" to get perfomance values.
   </p>
  </sect2>

  <sect2>
  <heading>The ALSA plugin</heading>
   <p>
   Your client must have been built with the <tt>--enable-alsa</tt> option.
   To use it, launch the vlc with the <tt>--aout alsa</tt> option.
   </p>
   <p>This plugin is new and has not been hard-tested. Please report bug to 
   <htmlurl url="mailto:vlc@videlan.org" name="vlc@videolan.org">.
   </p>
  </sect2>
 
  <sect2>
  <heading>The ESD plugin</heading>
   <p>
   Your client must have been built with the <tt>--enable-esd</tt> option.
   To use it, launch the vlc with the <tt>--aout esd</tt> option.
   </p>
   <p>
   This plugin is know for somtimes having causing a little delay between 
   the soud and the pictures.
   </p>
  </sect2>
  
  
  <sect2>
  <heading>Gnome interface</heading>
  <p>
  Rigth mouse button triggers a menu.
  Many features are not implemented yet, so don't make bug reports about missing features.

  <heading>Using the frame buffer</heading>
  <p>
  If you intend to use the frame buffer output, make sure you have ypan enabled. If not,
  add <tt>video=vesa:ypan</tt> in your lilo.conf and run lilo.
  If you have a matrox video device, add <tt>video=matroxfb:ypan</tt> in your lilo.conf 
  and run lilo.
