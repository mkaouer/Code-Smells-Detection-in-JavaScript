INSTALL file for vlc, the VideoLAN Client


Building VideoLAN
=================

A typical way to configure the vlc is :

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-mmx --enable-gnome

For a full compilation, you may try :

   ./configure --prefix=/usr --enable-mmx --enable-gnome --enable-fb \
           --enable-glide --enable-ggi --enable-mga --enable-esd --enable-alsa

See `./configure --help' for more information.

Then, run `make', and `make install' to install it.


To build a Debian package, you may use :

   dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot -us -uc


To build RedHat packages, use :

   rpm -ba vlc.spec


Installing and running VideoLAN
===============================

You can install the vlc and its plugins by typing :

   make install

But you don't need to do it if you don't want ; vlc can be launched
from the current directory as well :

   ./vlc
