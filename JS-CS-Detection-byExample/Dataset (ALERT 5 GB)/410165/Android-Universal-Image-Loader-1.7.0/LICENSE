Addition:
If you use Universal Image Loader code in your application you must inform the 
author about it ( email: nostra13[at]gmail[dot]com ) like this:
   I use Universal Image Loader in [ApplicationName] - http://link_to_google_play. 
   I [allow|don't allow] to mention my app in "Applications using Universal Image 
   Loader" on GitHub.
Also you should mention it (but it is not required) in application UI with string 
"Using Universal Image Loader (c) 2011, Sergey Tarasevich" (e.g. in some 
"About" section).
