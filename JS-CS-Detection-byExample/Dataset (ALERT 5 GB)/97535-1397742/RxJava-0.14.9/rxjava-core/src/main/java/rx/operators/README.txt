This package "rx.operators" is for internal implementation details and can change at any time.

It is excluded from the public Javadocs (http://netflix.github.io/RxJava/javadoc/) and should not be relied upon by any code.

In short, changes to public signatures of these classes will not be accounted for in the versioning of RxJava.
