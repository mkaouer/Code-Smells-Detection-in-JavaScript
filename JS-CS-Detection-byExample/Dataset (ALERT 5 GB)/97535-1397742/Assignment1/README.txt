The excel doc which says "understand graphs 1" consists the required graphs of the given metrics.

The word doc which says "SWEN-772 assignment 1" has the part1 of the assignment and also the part2 recommendations.

the RxJava versions are the versions that i have used and for simplicaity reasons in the graphs i have portrayed them
as versions 1-5 instead of the actual release numbers.

other excel files are the metrics extracted from understand tool.
