     * {@link Completable}s is onNext'd to the combinator to be flattened. If
     * the inner {@link Observable} is not immediately subscribed to an calls to
     * {@link Worker#schedule} are buffered. Once the {@link Observable} is
     * subscribed to actions are then onNext'd as {@link Completable}s.
     * <p>
     * Finally the actions scheduled on the parent {@link Scheduler} when the
     * inner most {@link Completable}s are subscribed to.
     * <p>
     * When the {@link Worker} is unsubscribed the {@link Completable} emits an

     * interesting benefits and drawbacks to the method above. It works by
     * limited the number of concurrent {@link Worker}s rather than individual
     * actions. Generally each {@link Observable} uses its own {@link Worker}.
     * This means that this will essentially limit the number of concurrent
     * subscribes. The danger comes from using operators like
     * {@link Observable#zip(Observable, Observable, rx.functions.Func2)} where
     * subscribing to the first {@link Observable} could deadlock the
     * subscription to the second.
