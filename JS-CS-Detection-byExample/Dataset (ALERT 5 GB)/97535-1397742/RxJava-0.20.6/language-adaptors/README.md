# Language Adaptors

RxJava includes language adaptor submodules. These modules are additive to the rxjava-core library in the classpath.

For example, to use the Scala adaptor you would have the rxjava-core-x.y.z.jar and rxjava-scala-x-y-z.jar.

If there is a language you'd like supported please look at the existing adaptors (such as <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/RxJava/blob/master/language-adaptors/rxjava-groovy">Groovy</a>) and implement the adaptor for your language of choice.

If you feel it would be valuable for the community submit a pull request and we'll accept it into the main project.

Please comply with the conventions established by the existing language adaptors if you intend to submit a pull request.
