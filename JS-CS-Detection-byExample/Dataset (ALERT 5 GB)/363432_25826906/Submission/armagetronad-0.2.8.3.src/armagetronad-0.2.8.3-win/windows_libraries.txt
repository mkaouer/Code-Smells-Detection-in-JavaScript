Here are some short directions on compiling Armagetron on windows.
You will need Visual C++ 6. The sources are distributed over three
CVS modules: the generic sources are in "armagetronad", the VisualC
build files are in "armagetronad_build_visualc" (which you probably
already have, since this file usually lives there) and the libraries
Armagetron depends on are in "armagetronad_winlibs". You need to
check out all three modules from the repository at
:ext:<your sf username>@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/armagetronad
for developers or
:pserver:anonymous@cvs.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/armagetronad
for everyone else.

1.  Create a project directory (e.g. C:\Projects\Armagetron)
3.  put the armagetronad source files there
4.  In the same directory, put the armagetronad_build_visualc files
4.  In the same directory, put the armagetronad_winlibs files
5.  It should look something like this:
    +- Armagetron
       +- armagetronad
       +- armagetronad_build_visualc
       +- armagetronad_winlibs
6.  Go to the armagetronad_build_visualc directory
7.  Run the makedist.bat file to build the Dist and Debug directories
8.  Start the Armagetron workspace (Armagetron.dsw)
9.  To compile you will need to change the build profile to either 
    Release or Debug (it defaults to Profile for some reason)
