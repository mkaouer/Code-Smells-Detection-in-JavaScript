	* language/english_base.txt, src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Uses
	  eVoter::AllowNameChange() to see if players are allowed to rename

2006-05-05 11:40  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycle.cpp: Attempt to make cycle collision handling
	  truly order independant.  When a cycle crosses a wall that is
	  built in its future, it no longer sees it as a danger. Until it
	  truly hits it, but then it notices it's from the future and
	  kills/resets the other cycle instead.

	  on team place shuffling.

2006-04-27 15:13  z-man

	* src/network/: nNetwork.h, nNetwork.cpp: Added debug recording
	  checkpoints to bandwidth usage.  Message size length changes from
	  time of recording and time of playback (from language file
	  changes, say) were affecting bandwith throttling and thus broke
	  playback. They still do, but not at higher debug levels.

2006-04-27 11:13  z-man

	* configure.ac: Activated custom directories, they seem to be safe.

	  src/engine/eTeam.h: Team change logic overhaul.  Team changes
	  between rounds are now only done if they don't violate balancing
	  constraints, players swapping teams is explicitly allowed.  The
	  need for the perm_imbalance setting has gone away and it has been
	  removed.

2006-04-26 09:11  z-man

	* src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Switching spectator state is now

	  language/english_base_notranslate.txt: Moved the perfect 180 hack
	  once again, this time into gCycle::DoTurn.  When a cycle drops
	  its current wall, all other cycles check their faces immediately.
	  Anti-Phasing walldrops now have a limited frequency.

2006-04-23 20:18  z-man

	* src/network/nNetwork.cpp: More debug checkpoint data logged in a
	  recording: message sizes, message sends and rate control.

2006-04-23 20:01  z-man

	* src/tools/tDirectories.cpp: Better check whether AA is run from

2006-04-14 20:03  z-man

	* src/: engine/eCamera.cpp, tron/gCycleMovement.cpp: Fixed spawn
	  camera bug.

2006-04-14 14:37  z-man

	* NEWS: Updated.

2006-04-14 14:31  z-man

	* Makefile.am: Added accustomdir to distributed files.

2006-04-14 14:31  z-man

	* configure.ac: Refined default deviation warning, if you
	  explicitly ask for an off-default value, it won't come.

2006-04-14 13:54  z-man

	* configure.ac: Bending of localstatedir to /var is only done if
	  automake default doesn't exist.  Added warning about various
	  things that go outside of ${prefix} at the end of the run.

2006-04-14 11:17  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycle.cpp: Ok, now the perfect 180s really work
	  reliably and you never end up on the wrong side.  Before the
	  current face is found, the directions are blown up to gigantic
	  proportions to tell the face-finding code that they're much more
	  important than the current position (which will be exactly on top
	  of a grid point).  Sometimes, you'll get stuck on your own wall,
	  though. We'll have to live with that.

2006-04-13 23:51  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg: Increased CYCLE_RUBBER_MINADJUST for
	  techical reasons: avoids graphical artefacts, and gives the cycle
	  movement code a bit more floating point resolution to work with.

2006-04-13 23:50  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycle.cpp: Installed better hack to find a good face
	  after a turn, postscriptum: Also handled the other kind of
	  perfect 180 better.

2006-04-13 23:15  z-man

	* src/tron/: gCycleMovement.cpp, gCycle.cpp: Installed better hack
	  to find a good face after a turn: After the cycle wall is
	  tropped, we call eGameObject::FindCurrentFace so that it finds
	  the face the cycle is about to enter.

2006-04-13 21:42  z-man

	* src/tools/tDirectories.cpp: Compatibility for non-autoconfed
	  systems restored.

2006-04-12 23:28  wrtlprnft

	* src/: engine/ePlayer.cpp, tron/gGame.cpp: - improved scorelog.txt
	  by adding team scores and timestamps - added more characters to
	  the replacing list used to get the internal player name and made
	  it case insensitive - trailing spaces in player names are now
	  ignored for the internal player names, resulting in "PlAyEr 1
	  " and "player 1" being regarded the same name

2006-04-12 11:29  luke-jr

	* accustomdir.m4, acinclude.m4, configure.ac: autoconf custom
	  directory support, disabled

2006-04-11 23:05  z-man

	* src/tron/: gCycle.h, gWall.cpp: Repaired topology police, it was
	  throwing unhandled exceptions.

2006-04-08 00:26  z-man

	* language/deutsch.txt: Translated the various items that have
	  accumulated.

	  config/settings_dedicated.cfg: Added TEAM_CENTER_IS_BOSS to
	  control who gets to name the team and call chat timeouts.

2006-04-06 19:32  z-man

	* src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Better error message for /teamleave if it
	  is not supported /shuffle is now an alias for /teamshuffle

2006-04-05 10:41  z-man

	* Makefile.am: Fixed bindir location of master server installation.

2006-04-05 10:21  z-man

	* language/english_base.txt, src/tron/gMenus.cpp: Added missing
	  persistency of 24 hour clock flag.

2006-04-05 10:19  z-man

	* configure.ac: More flexible SDL library detection, checks the
	  result of sdl-config --libs to get the name of the SDL libray
	  (isn't always SDL)

2006-04-05 09:45  z-man

	* language/deutsch.txt: Clarifying warnings about dangerous
	  settings.

2006-04-05 09:45  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg: Pointed out that the file must be in TEXT
	  MODE.

	  src/engine/ePlayer.h, src/engine/eTeam.cpp, src/engine/eTeam.h,
	  config/settings_dedicated.cfg: New chat commands: /teamleave to
	  leave the team and /teamshuffle to change position in your team.

2006-04-05 09:42  z-man

	* src/network/nServerInfo.cpp: Servers polled over master now get a
	  10% chance of being polled again, so they can be removed from the
	  list eventually as they go offline.

2006-04-05 09:42  z-man

	* src/engine/eCamera.cpp: Fixed framerate dependency, a faulty
	  assignment slipped in somewhere in the middle of the smart camera
	  code.

2006-03-30 09:53  z-man

	* acinclude.m4: Directory command lines now use --with, not
	  --enable.

2006-03-30 09:52  z-man

	* batch/sysinstall.in: Bugfix: disabled configuration movement on
	  uninstall.

2006-03-30 09:04  z-man

	* Makefile.am, Makefile.manual, Makefile.paths, batch/Makefile.am,
	  batch/make/uninstall, config/Makefile.am, desktop/Makefile.am,
	  resource/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, src/doc/HtmlMakefile,
	  src/doc/Makefile.am, src/first/Makefile.am: Moved all paths from
	  Makefile.pats back to the individual Makefile.am's. All the
	  shared information now is passed down from the configure script
	  directly and determined there.

2006-03-30 00:35  z-man

	* config/rc.config.in: Added examples for other var directories.

2006-03-30 00:34  z-man

	* Makefile.manual: Added test for var directory moving.

2006-03-30 00:34  z-man

	* configure.ac: Added moving of old var directory.  Added searching
	  for more gamy binary directory.

2006-03-30 00:33  z-man

	* acinclude.m4, batch/sysinstall.in: Optimized script relocation.
	  Added moving of old var directory.

2006-03-29 20:34  z-man

	* src/tools/tDirectories.cpp, Makefile.manual, configure.ac,
	  batch/sysinstall.in, config/rc.config.in, src/Makefile.am: New
	  internal relocation mechanism (like sed -e
	  "s,^${prefix_compiled},${prefix_installed},") and various
	  adaptions. We should now be fully auto* compliant.

2006-03-29 17:28  z-man

	* batch/Makefile.am, batch/rcd_config.in, batch/sysinstall.in,
	  src/tools/tDirectories.cpp, Makefile.am, Makefile.paths,
	  configure.ac: First round of path adaptions. All scripts now use
	  the new system exclusively.

2006-03-29 16:24  z-man

	* Makefile.manual, batch/sysinstall.in: Disabled useradd waring in
	  installation test mode.

2006-03-29 16:21  z-man

	* configure.ac: Added all automake contributed paths to the
	  unversal variable and relocation system. Now we just have to use
	  them :)

2006-03-29 16:21  z-man

	* src/Makefile.am: Added dependency of tDirectories on
	  tUniversalVariables.h

2006-03-29 16:18  z-man

	* acinclude.m4: Removed some output clutter, added more support
	  macros around AC_AA_DIR.

2006-03-29 14:29  z-man

	* Makefile.am: Fixed dist-hook: calling the bootstrap script from
	  the source directory instead of the distribution directory did
	  not work. I wonder how it ever could work, and why I chose this.
	  Anyway, now bootstrap.sh is copied into ${distdir} and called
	  directly from there.	Added new distclean removals of files
	  generated by the universal variable scheme.

2006-03-29 14:24  z-man

	* batch/sysinstall.in: Added support for automatic relocation
	  directories.

2006-03-29 14:23  z-man

	* batch/masterstarter.in: Removed --deamon command line, the master
	  does not support it (copy/paste error)

2006-03-29 14:15  z-man

	* src/Makefile.am: Added generation of tUniversalVariables.h from
	  tUniversalVariables.h.in (generated by config.status) via the sed
	  replacement script from the top directory (generated by a
	  makefile included here, generated by config.status, phew).

2006-03-29 14:13  z-man

	* batch/Makefile.am: Added universal variable substitution to
	  script generation make rule.	Special make rule for sysinstall:
	  the sed rules for relocation get injected.

2006-03-29 14:08  z-man

	* configure.ac: Repaired gnu make deteciton (now really) Added
	  hooks so AC_SUBST_UNIVERSAL and AC_AA_PATH work and the makefiles
	  that rely on it don't fail.

2006-03-29 14:01  z-man

	* acinclude.m4: Added universal variables (available in .in
	  substitutions, as CPP #defines and makefile variables) and
	  adapted directories to use them.

2006-03-29 01:09  z-man

	* acinclude.m4: Added preliminary version automatic path
	  substitution macro.

2006-03-28 09:10  z-man

	* AUTHORS: Added new members and contributions.

2006-03-28 00:33  z-man

	* src/network/nServerInfo.cpp: Master server selection now uses a
	  reproducible randomizer, making recordings with multiple master
	  server visits reliable.

2006-03-28 00:06  z-man

	* batch/sysinstall.in: More BSD stuff: aactl script is now
	  installed into ${prefix}/sbin, and master server support was
	  added as well (untested).  System touching stuff now is only
	  executed if DESTDIR and ROOTDIR are empty.

2006-03-28 00:04  z-man

	* Makefile.am, configure.ac, src/Makefile.am, src/first/.cvsignore,
	  src/first/Makefile.am: Added call to uninstallation script of
	  previous version at the start of "make install".  This probably
	  breaks --enable-multiver. No active build configuration uses
	  that, so it's likely it's in a bad state anyway.

2006-03-27 21:11  z-man

	* src/Makefile.am, Makefile.am, Makefile.manual,
	  batch/sysinstall.in, batch/make/uninstall: Handling of DESTDIR
	  completely fixed.  New installation relevant variable: ROOTDIR.
	  It marks the place where the files will end up at.

2006-03-27 21:10  z-man

	* NEWS: BSD compatibility, DESTDIR fixes.

2006-03-27 21:08  z-man

	  files on startup.

2006-03-27 21:08  z-man

	* batch/: masterstarter.in, serverstarter.in: Switched strange echo
	  "commands" | bash -i construct with a regular bash function Added
	  guards that prevent the servers from starting too quickly

2006-03-27 21:07  z-man

	* configure.ac: Fixed bash and gmake detection Refactored unix
	  flavor handling to be less redundant Added detection of OpenBSD
	  and its special init script handling

2006-03-27 20:17  z-man

	* configure.ac: Fixed GNU Make and bash detection

2006-03-25 09:32  z-man

	* src/tools/tDirectories.cpp: Disaled path debug output.  Fixed
	  debug configuration path fallback, the configuration search order
	  was wrong.

2006-03-25 09:31  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg, language/english_base_notranslate.txt,
	  src/render/rFont.cpp: Made font selection configurable.

2006-03-25 00:54  z-man

	  fixed, server-running user can now be added with pw.

2006-03-24 23:19  z-man

	  gets the executable path from three sources: binreloc, the
	  compmpiled in prefix, or the command line used for starting.

2006-03-24 23:18  z-man

	* src/: tron/gArmagetron.cpp, tron/gGame.cpp, ui/uInputQueue.cpp,
	  ui/uInputQueue.h, ui/uMenu.cpp: Added ENDINPUT marker to
	  recordings so a quick keypress after leaving a submenu does not
	  cause havoc.

2006-03-24 23:17  z-man

	* src/tron/gParser.cpp: More flexible detection of the xml catalog.

2006-03-24 23:16  z-man

	* src/engine/eSound.cpp: Added bogus use of otherwise unused
	  variable.

2006-03-24 23:15  z-man

	* src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Sane use of ?:, the two arguments had
	  different types sometimes.

2006-03-24 23:14  z-man

	* config/rc.config.in: User running the server is now armagetronad,
	  not armagetronad-dedicated.

2006-03-24 23:14  z-man

	* batch/make/sortresources: Failure -> exit 1, was failure -> exit
	  -1 which was incompatible with BSD.

	  sourced.

2006-03-24 23:10  z-man

	  real bash is found.

2006-03-24 23:09  z-man

	* configure.ac: Compiled-in PREFIX now correctly set to allow the
	  game to work where binreloc is not supported (without
	  relocation).

2006-03-23 18:40  z-man

	* batch/sysinstall.in: Added a couple of missing $DESTDIRs, please
	  use "make cvscheck" to test installation/uninstallation/server
	  init scripts.

	  path manipulations.

2005-11-21 12:00  z-man

	* src/network/nNetwork.cpp: Fixed Ack-Ack bug: Ack packets were
	  sent with an ID and got an Ack response. If both client and
	  server were affected, this results in high (but generally
	  unproblematic) network load.

2005-11-21 11:59  z-man

	* src/tron/gWinZone.cpp: Changed fortess game settings to
	  tSettingItem. The clients don't need to know about it.

	  client.

2005-11-18 18:49  z-man

	  and restoring of line strings ending in a backslash.

2005-11-17 23:54  z-man

	* src/engine/: ePlayer.cpp, ePlayer.h: Instant chat strings ending
	  in a backslash will not be sent immediately, they open up the
	  chat line with the corresponding text.  Updated default instant
	  chat lines.

2005-11-17 22:49  nemostultae

	* src/tools/tString.cpp: Added dash to default delimiters

	  fix, checking the file has been modified

2005-11-17 15:18  z-man

	* src/network/nNetObject.cpp: Object destroy messages are no longer
	  sent at all opportunities (they are not high priority); rather,
	  they wait for other sync messages to sit in the same UDP packet
	  so they don't waste as much bandwidth.

2005-11-17 15:13  z-man

	* src/network/nNetwork.cpp: Removed another wait cycle for ack
	  sending. Ping measurements are now even lower.  Ack messages are
	  now sent as attachments to all packets, whether there is
	  bandwidth available or not. They need this priority.

2005-11-17 13:49  z-man

	* src/ui/uMenu.cpp: Added Nemo's extended line editing keybindings.
	  Fixed bug where trying to write beyond the line limit, the keys
	  got interpreted by the generic input system and could trigger
	  other events.

2005-11-17 13:46  z-man

	  message]

2005-11-17 03:48  nemostultae

	  to determine_version_release (was returning an array filled with
	  a string, we just want the string)

2005-11-17 03:39  nemostultae

	* MacOS/Armagetron Advanced.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Remove files
	  from project that are in CVS checkouts but absent from release
	  sources

2005-11-17 03:30  nemostultae

	* MacOS/Armagetron Advanced.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj: Adapted to

	  build scripts to work on release sorces.

2005-11-16 11:35  z-man

	* src/tools/tRecorder.cpp: Z-Man needs some lessons in boolean
	  algebra :) Fixed line string reading of escaped characters.

2005-11-16 10:14  z-man

	* src/tron/gGame.cpp: Reshuffled deconstruction of game: first come
	  the objects, then the grid. This fixes the bogus "possible phase
	  bug" warning.

2005-11-16 09:22  z-man

	* config/settings_dedicated.cfg: Added a clarifying comment.

2005-11-15 15:28  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg, language/deutsch.txt,
	  language/english_base.txt, src/engine/eCamera.cpp: Bugfix: after
	  a DB 180, the internal and custom cameras no longer stay locked
	  in the wrong direction.  Added settings for camera turn speed.

2005-11-15 13:34  z-man

	* src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Fixed nonsensical sending of team change
	  wish message right after player creation on the client.

	* config/settings.cfg, language/deutsch.txt,
	  language/english_base.txt, src/engine/eCamera.cpp: Added new
	  property to custom camera: it now zooms out from a closeup of the
	  team formation to its final position during the countdown. This
	  makes it easier to know where your position in the team is.

2005-11-14 23:56  z-man

	* src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Added BUG_COLOR_OVERFLOW (default: old
	  behavior, flag is enabled) so server admins can disable the trail
	  color bug if it annoys them. The color values are always clamped
	  if the player is member of a team.

2005-11-14 23:54  z-man

	* src/engine/eCamera.cpp: Forgot to check index validity in last
	  fix.

	  Type=Application entry.

2005-11-14 14:33  z-man

	  strings so a \n can be distinguished from \\n.

2005-11-14 09:44  z-man

	* src/engine/eTimer.cpp: Fixed inaccuracy of average frame time
	  when paused for too long.

2005-11-14 08:37  z-man

	* minor_version: YYYYMMDD in minor_version is replaced by DATE. We
	  need to stick to a single date format.

2005-11-14 08:37  z-man

	* batch/make/version: Version generation now understands CVS tags:
	  if the sources are locked to a version tag, the version is
	  generated from that. If the sources are locked to a date tag,
	  that date is used instead of the touch date.	YYYYMMDD in
	  minor_version is replaced by DATE. We need to stick to a single
	  date format.

2005-11-13 19:13  z-man

	* src/tron/: gWall.cpp, gWall.h: Improved replacement of
	  preliminary walls with final walls: the overlap of the new
	  (final) and old (preliminary) wall in creation time is taken as
	  the main criterion, and the direction of the two walls.  If it is
	  noticed that the current wall of a cycle has gotten a final
	  replacement (this was ignored before), a flag is set in the wall
	  that causes it to be inserted into the grid (and thus deleted)
	  immediately after the cycle's next turn.

2005-11-13 19:09  z-man

	* src/: engine/eTimer.cpp, engine/eTimer.h, tron/gGame.cpp,
	  tron/gHud.cpp: The screen now stays blank as long as the timer
	  says synchronization is not yet complete, just as it does the
	  first half second of every round.  The timer detects that by
	  measuring the variance of the received syncs. The non-complete
	  status stays in effect for at most ten seconds, starting with the
	  timer's creation.

2005-11-13 19:07  z-man

	* src/tools/tString.cpp: Changes to SubStr: the len parameter has
	  to be smaller than zero to trigger taking the whole rest of the
	  string; sometimes you really want a zero length substring (to
	  avoid having to do special case coding).

2005-11-13 19:05  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg, language/deutsch.txt,
	  language/english_base.txt, src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Pressing
	  instant chat keys, should they be keys that don't generate
	  characters (function keys, cursor keys) during chat now insert
	  the corresponding instant chat.  Added a configuration item that
	  allows issuing cycle control commands from whithin chat (thereby
	  losing chat protection status, of course).

2005-11-13 19:02  z-man

	* config/default.cfg: Added console input key.	Made F2 an instant
	  chat key, screenshots are now taken with "Print Screen".

2005-11-13 17:54  philippeqc

	* resource/proto/map.dtd: map.dtd

2005-11-13 00:28  z-man

	* src/: engine/eCamera.cpp, engine/eCamera.h, tron/gCamera.cpp:
	  Switched camera center from using the object ID (which varies) to
	  a pointer to the game object itself.

2005-11-12 19:30  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg: Adapted settings for rim wall shadows.

2005-11-12 19:30  z-man

	* src/tron/: gWall.cpp, gWall.h: gWallRim constructor now also
	  accepts texture coordinates.	Improved shadows, they are now
	  displayed less often and don't flicker on and off that
	  annoyingly.

2005-11-12 19:28  z-man

	* src/tron/: gParser.cpp, gParser.h: Added crude texture coordinate
	  generation for rim walls to fix the texture stretching bug.

2005-11-12 19:28  z-man

	* config/settings_dedicated.cfg: Added setting for configurable
	  repeat spam protection.

2005-11-12 19:27  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycleMovement.cpp: Fixed rubber warping bug: when the
	  rubber code reverts the position to a previous value, it now also
	  reverts the current face.

2005-11-12 19:27  z-man

	* src/engine/ePlayer.cpp: Made repeat spam protection configurable,
	  sent a warning to the offending client.

2005-11-12 19:26  z-man

	* src/engine/eVoter.cpp: XXX, which was used as player name for
	  players who already disconnected, was replaced by something
	  describing the situation.

2005-11-12 19:26  z-man

	* language/: deutsch.txt, english_base.txt: Added new texts for
	  configurable repeat spam protection.

2005-11-12 09:30  z-man

	* src/render/: rModel.cpp, rTexture.cpp: Fixed resource (GL texture
	  and display lists) leaks

2005-11-10 23:41  z-man

	* minor_version: Fell back to _alphaYYYYMMDD version.

2005-11-09 23:35  z-man

	* src/tools/tResourceManager.cpp: Beautified.

2005-11-09 23:27  z-man

	* src/network/nSocket.cpp: Fixed gcc 4.0 compatibility, the include
	  reshuffling broke it.

2005-11-09 21:45  z-man

	* src/: defs.h, engine/eAxis.h, engine/eTimer.cpp,
	  network/nNetwork.cpp, network/nSocket.cpp, render/rModel.cpp,
	  thirdparty/particles/papi.h, tools/tCallback.h,
	  tools/tDirectories.cpp, tools/tRecorder.cpp,
	  tools/tRecorderInternal.h, tools/tResourceManager.cpp,
	  tools/tString.h, tron/gParticles.cpp, tron/gParticles.h,
	  ui/uInput.cpp, win32/config_common.h: Reshuffled includes so that
	  config.h comes first.  Added some preprocessor magic for Visual
	  Studio 2005 compatibility.  Disambiguated some fabs calls.

2005-11-08 00:29  z-man

	* src/engine/eTimer.cpp: Whoops, timer was smoothed on Linux.
	  Fixed.  Timer sycing status was stored every frame in a
	  recording. Fixed.  Added emergency recovery code in for NAN and
	  other infinite time values.

2005-11-08 00:28  z-man

	* src/tools/tSysTime.cpp: Fixed return value of tTimerIsAccurate()
	  on Windows, it was the wrong way round.

2005-11-08 00:27  z-man

	* src/network/nNetwork.cpp: Fixed nAverager::GetAverageVariance()
	  to never return infinite values.

2005-11-08 00:23  z-man

	  and server type info to the release info.

2005-11-05 20:43  z-man

	* config/settings_dedicated.cfg, src/engine/ePlayer.cpp,
	  src/network/nConfig.cpp, src/network/nNetwork.cpp,
	  src/network/nNetwork.h, src/tools/tConfiguration.cpp,
	  src/tron/gGame.cpp, src/tron/gMenus.cpp: Adaptions to tString
	  changes (quoting in input): configuration items now use quoted
	  input.  Consolidated MESSAGE_OF_DAY and ROUND_CONSOLE_MESSAGE
	  into single items; you can get multi-line messages by including
	  "\n" into the setting.

2005-11-05 20:41  z-man

	* src/engine/: eTeam.cpp, eTeam.h: Added younges player finding

	  characters to streaming input functions.

2005-11-05 20:39  z-man

	  position.

2005-11-05 20:37  z-man

	* src/engine/: eGrid.cpp, eGrid.h: Fixed crash: sometimes, the
	  simplifying code would get the great idea to simplify one of the
	  tree corners grid away. This caused trouble on the next
	  expansion.

2005-11-04 22:22  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg, src/ui/uInput.cpp: Fixed berserking
	  doublebind detection code.

2005-11-04 19:50  z-man

	* src/tron/: gCycle.cpp, gCycle.h, gCycleMovement.cpp,
	  gCycleMovement.h, gWall.cpp, gWall.h: Refactoring:
	  gCycleMovement.cpp no longer depends on gCycle.h.  Anti-Phasing
	  improvement: cycles now also drop their current wall if the last
	  wall is grinded. This avoids getting stuck at fresh corners.
	  More Anti-Phasing: the call to FindCurrentFace() in DoTurn() is
	  now done before updating the new driving directions, so the
	  correct face is more likely to be found.

2005-11-04 14:46  z-man

	  a bit late on the client) by hacking in a fudge factor.

2005-11-04 09:05  z-man

	  The new algoritm rejects killers that are not allowed to be
	  enemies by configuration; then, it tries to find an enemy killer,
	  then a team killer, then it concludes it must have been suicide.
	  All the time, the owner of the wall you smashed into is given a
	  slight preference.

	  timeout now scales up with number of users.  Disconnecting and
	  reconnecting does not protect you against running votes.

2005-10-01 19:00  z-man

	* src/engine/eTimer.cpp: Made the timer smooth faster to the known
	  best value at the beginning of the round.

2005-09-29 09:06  z-man

2005-09-27 20:06  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycle.cpp: Made last known good position lie closer to
	  the current position.

2005-09-27 20:04  z-man

	* src/engine/eGameObject.cpp: Softened timeout condition.

2005-09-26 20:52  z-man

	* src/: render/rModel.cpp, render/rModel.h, render/rScreen.cpp,
	  render/rScreen.h, tron/gMenus.cpp: Refactored display lists flag
	  so it now is defined in rScreen.h.  Activate display lists on
	  NVIdia cards by default.  Default to glFinish swap mode,
	  whitelist NVidia cards and ATI cards on the Mac for glFlush.

2005-09-26 20:48  z-man

	* src/: engine/eGameObject.cpp, tron/gAIBase.cpp: Fixed crash in
	  pathfinding code when gameobject's current face was no longer in
	  the grid.

2005-09-26 18:20  z-man

	* src/tron/: gCycleMovement.cpp, gCycle.cpp: Fixed crash caused by

	  when a turn was made at the very first possible moment.

2005-09-26 10:43  z-man

	* src/tools/tCommandLine.cpp: Added newline in "needs another
	  argument" error message.

2005-09-25 22:59  z-man

	* src/doc/: index.html.m4, install_linux.html.m4,
	  install_result.html.m4, install_windows.html.m4, network.html.m4,
	  versions.html.m4: Various documentation updates.

2005-09-25 22:58  z-man

	* src/tron/: gCycle.cpp, gCycleMovement.cpp: Fixed synchronization
	  bug: When a quick client turn command would get to the server
	  early, the server would pass it to the cycle and mark it as used,
	  but the cycle may only execute it delayed. The next sync back to
	  the client would have inconsistent information. The server now no
	  longer issues turn commands when they are not possible, and the
	  client recognizes inconsistent syncs from older servers and
	  corrects them.

2005-09-25 22:55  z-man

	* src/doc/config.html.m4: Added documentation of rubber settings.

2005-09-25 22:54  z-man

	  a delay even in playback mode.

2005-09-25 10:23  z-man

	* src/engine/eGameObject.cpp: Adapted to new return value
	  possibility in eHalfEdge::IntersectWithCareless: an off-axis
	  intersection point of the moving edge and the edge of the current
	  face gets a score malus.  Added debug retry on move command in
	  eGameObject::FindCurrentFace().

2005-09-25 10:19  z-man

	* src/engine/eGrid.cpp: eHalfEdge::IntersectWithCareless() gives
	  now more sensible results for almost parallel edges; it returns
	  the eges' center of gravity, where the shorter edge is considered
	  heavier.

2005-09-25 10:18  z-man

	* src/engine/: eAxis.cpp, eAxis.h: Driving axes are now snapped to
	  coordinate axes if they are close; this avoids floating point
	  trouble later.

2005-09-24 22:34  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycleMovement.cpp: Fixed another instance of phasing.

2005-09-24 22:33  z-man

2005-09-24 17:34  z-man

	* src/: engine/eTeam.cpp, tron/gGame.cpp: Fixed memory leak when
	  empty teams get created.  Fixed team balancing; empty teams are
	  not allowed when several people are on the same team.

2005-09-24 17:32  z-man

	* src/engine/: eGameObject.cpp, eGameObject.h: Fixed bug that made
	  only one of two temporary walls that lay exactly on top of each
	  other count in collisions.  FindCurrentFace() now makes sure the
	  current face really surrounds the current position.

2005-09-21 22:59  z-man

	* www-root/.cvsignore: file .cvsignore was added on branch b0_2_8

	  master server.

2005-09-09 00:18  z-man

	* src/: tron/gArmagetron.cpp, ui/uMenu.cpp: Added special exception

	  Fixed relocation code: it now is cleaner and works in the most
	  general situation. (Autopackage installation into home directory
	  was broken).

2005-09-08 23:27  z-man

	* src/tron/gAIBase.cpp: Made initial period where the AI drives

2005-09-02 23:14  z-man

	* src/network/nNetwork.cpp: Disabled filling of snail ping averager

	* src/engine/eCamera.cpp: Disabled inintial camera switching in
	  spectator mode.

2005-09-02 14:47  z-man

2005-08-31 21:33  z-man

	* src/doc/Makefile.am: Forgot to remove testing typo...

	* Makefile.manual, batch/sysinstall.in,
	  desktop/armagetronad.desktop.in: KDE icons and startmenu now also

	  on testing).

2005-08-31 13:57  z-man

	* src/tron/gWall.cpp: Fixed random lowering of all walls.

2005-08-31 13:57  z-man

	* config/settings.cfg: Added CYCLE_PACKETLOSS_TOLERANCE to
	  settings, defaults to disabled because it may promote cheating if

2005-08-31 13:56  z-man

	* src/tron/: gCycleMovement.cpp, gCycleMovement.h, gCycle.cpp:

	  on turns when watching someone else.

2005-08-30 20:23  z-man

	* src/tron/gCycle.cpp: Sync code now sets the laggometer, it's no
	  longer dependant on ePlayer::ping (which can be way off).  Fixed

	  wrong direction.

2005-08-30 20:21  z-man

2005-08-30 20:20  z-man

	* src/engine/eTimer.cpp: Moderately bad syncs are accepted, but
	  with lower relevance. That way, long periods completely without
	  syncs are avoided.

2005-08-30 20:19  z-man

	* src/engine/: eNetGameObject.cpp, eNetGameObject.h: Added
	  non-smoothed laggometer variable; it does not get updated by
	  Timestep() for enemies on the client (so it can be set to the
	  right value by the cycle sync code)

2005-08-30 14:43  z-man

	* src/tron/gParser.cpp: Fixed crashes on failed validation; doc was
	  deleted, but not set to NULL, so it was attempted to delete it
	  again on the next call.

2005-08-30 14:38  z-man

	* resource/proto/: map-0.1-exp.dtd, map-0.1.dtd: Changed default
	  category to "unsorted", a change that should not affect
