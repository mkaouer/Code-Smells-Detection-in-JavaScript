	     the Q1 source (better resolution). Removed a bug from the
	     Linux version that caused a lockup on the first start
	     of Armagetron Advanced.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><strong>2000/02/22</strong></td><td>Begun work on network code by stealing net_udp.c and
	     net_udp.h from ID's Q1 sources.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><strong>2000/02/21</strong></td><td>Unfortunately, yesterday's changes do not work in 
             Windows.
             Disabled them for the Windows version.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><strong>2000/02/20</strong></td><td>Input is now asyncronous to graphic

             and the possibility to change screen resolution.</td></tr>

<tr><td valign=top><strong>2000/02/03</strong></td><td>added text output and menu system; 
              found nasty memory eater
             (Mesa only? Texture memory is never freed,
