<a name=><h1 align=center> Installation</h1></a>

<a name=><h2 align=left>General comments</h2></a>
<p align=justify>
All systemwide installation has to be carried out as root. 
Installation from a source archive is recommended,
as Armagetron Advanced will be tailored for your system and missing libraries will be identified and
pointed out to you. 
Only as a last resort, you should choose the binary archives. 
The binary RPMs and Debian packages are a reasonable choice 
if your system supports them and you can get hold of
the corresponding library packages in the right versions.
</p>
<p align=justify>
It is very important that Armagetron and all of its dependencies are built with the same
compiler. The different versions of gcc tend to be slightly binary incompatible with each other,
and on complex projects like this one these small glitches tend to cause unexplainable problems.
The distributed binaries are compiled with gcc 3.3, and we test source compatibility with 3.4 
and 4.0 regularly. Yes, theoretically the binary interface for C code (ABI)
did not change, but be prepared for problems nevertheless.
</p>

<a name=libs><h2 align=left>Required libraries</h2></a>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://http://www.xmlsoft.org/" target=_top><strong>LibXML2</strong></a> version 2.6.0 (some binaries: 2.6.12) or later for map file parsing</li>
<li>OpenGL or <a href="http://mesa3d.sourceforge.net/" target=_top><strong>Mesa</strong></a> for rendering</li>
<li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org" target=_top><strong>SDL</strong></a> version 1.2.x (Simple Direct Media Layer) for input and sound output</li>
<li><a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/index.html" target=_top><strong>SDL_image</strong></a>
version 1.2.x for the textures
which itself needs the libs</li>
<li><a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/pngcode.html" target=_top><strong>pnglib and zlib</strong></a>
(they should be included in your distribution)</li>
<li>Optional: <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/" target=_top><strong>SDL_mixer</strong></a></li>
<li>Binary versions only: libstdc++ 5.0.7 (any 5.x.y or whatever came with
your System if it uses GCC 3.2 or higher should do). Use 
<a href="http://rpmfind.net/linux/rpm2html/search.php?query=libstdc%2B%2B&submit=Search+...&system=&arch=" target=_top><strong>rpmfind</strong></a>
or
<a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&q=libstdc%2B%2B+5.0.7&btnG=Search" target=_top><strong>google</strong></a>
to find a RPM with that library for your system. Sorry, Debian users: I don't know what you need to do; use the
source packages instead.</li>
</ul>

<p align=justify></p>

<a name=><h2 align=left>Installation</h2></a>

<a name=source><h3 align=left>Source archive</h3></a>
<p align=justify>
Unpack the archive and change into the unpacked directory; type 
<pre>./configure
gmake install</pre>
Everything will be copied to <strong>/usr/local/games/armagetron</strong>. 
Should there already be a version, it will be overwritten (see the section on
<a href="install_linux.html#multiple" target=_top>multiple versions</a> if you want to keep your old
version around).
If <strong>gmake</strong> is not found on your system, try 
<strong>make</strong>; however, only GNU make is supported.
To build the dedicated server, add the option <strong>--disable-glout</strong> to the configure script.
To change the installation path, use the option <strong>--prefix=new_path</strong>.
Type <pre>uninstall-armagetronad-0.2.8.3.2</pre> to uninstall.
</p>

<p align=justify>
Please <a href="http://armagetron.sf.net/contact.html" target=_top><strong>report it</strong></a> if this procedure gives you errors you cannot
resolve; the goal is to make it work on as many systems as possible.
</p>

<a name=rpm><h3 align=left>Binary RPM</h3></a>
<p align=justify>
Type <pre>rpm -i filename.rpm</pre> The RPM build is quite untested, so it may be
that it has registered too many dependencies and you are not allowed to install it; 
you may use the additional switch <strong>--nodeps</strong> to ignore these errors. However, you
may then end up with a broken installation.<br>
The documentation can then found in <strong>/usr/share/doc/armagetronad</strong>.
To uninstall, use <pre>rpm -e armagetronad</pre>
</p>



<a name=><h3 align=left>Source RPM</h3></a>
<p align=justify>
Type <pre>rpm --rebuild filename.src.rpm</pre> 
This should build binary RPMs suitable for your system in <strong>/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386</strong> (RedHat)
resp. <strong>/usr/src/packages/RPMS/i386</strong> (SuSE); you may have to look into the other subdirectories
of <strong>RPMS</strong> to find them. Proceed as described in the <a href="install_linux.html#rpm" target=_top>previous paragraph</a>.<br>
Alternatively, type <pre>rpm -i filename.src.rpm</pre>
This should extract a source package in <strong>/usr/src/.../SOURCES</strong> you can handle like
described <a href="install_linux.html#source" target=_top>in the first section</a>. You can
surely ignore all failed dependencies with <strong>--nodeps</strong> since the 
dependencies were all there when you built the package. (It is possible,
if not likely, that the automatic dependency generation of RPM produces
junk.)
</p>

<a name=><h3 align=left>Non-Root install</h3></a>
<p align=justify>
You have the option to install the game as a regular user in your home directory. To do so, use
the <strong>--prefix</strong> directive of <strong>rpm</strong> or the <strong>configure</strong> script to point to a 
place in your home directory, i.e.
<pre>./configure --prefix /home/username/usr</pre>
You can then start the game with
<pre>/home/username/usr/bin/armagetronad</pre>
or, if you add <strong>/home/username/usr/bin</strong> to your executable search path, like normal.
</p>

<a name=multiple><h3 align=left>Multiple versions</h3></a>
If you give the additional option <strong>--enable-multiver</strong> to <strong>configure</strong>, all installation
directories and executables will get the suffix <strong>0.2.8.3.2</strong>. Symbolic links will be created to
your convenience. This allows to install multiple versions in parallel, where <strong>armagetronad</strong> will
always start the last installed version. 



<a name=><h2 align=left>Dedicated Server</h2></a>
<p align=justify>
To install the dedicated server from binaries,
follow all the procedures above with the corresponding
download files; the server will be installed in
<strong>usr/local/games/armagetronad-dedicated-dedicated</strong> and can be invoked by
<pre>armagetronad-dedicated-dedicated</pre>
Use the <strong>--disable-glout</strong> option of <strong>configure</strong> to build a dedicated server
when you are installing from source.
</p>

<p align=justify>
An init.d style start/stop script called <strong>armagetronad-dedicated</strong> will be installed into <strong>/etc/init.d</strong>,
so you can use your standard system utilities to let it be started at boot time. By default, it runs
the server under the userid armagetronad-dedicated-dedicated (which gets created at installation) and logs
activity in <strong>/var/games/armagetronad-dedicated-dedicated</strong>. You can change these settings in the
configuration file <strong>/etc/armagetronad/rc.config</strong>.
Unfortunately, the only way to give
commands to the server when it is run this way is to put them into <strong>everytime.cfg</strong> which is 
read every round or through the ingame admin.
</p>



<a name=><h2 align=left>Play</h2></a>
<p align=justify>
Type <pre>armagetronad</pre>
as a normal user to play.
