WINDOWS BUILD NOTES
===================

Compilers Supported
-------------------
MinGW GCC  http://tdm-gcc.tdragon.net/
   TDM-GCC with gcc 4.5.1 was used to build this release.
MSYS 1.0.11 was also used (sh needed to compile some dependencies)


Candidate releases were built with MSVC 10.0 (2010), but
compiling with Visual C++ caused rendering artifacts when
bitcoin was run.


Dependencies
------------
Libraries you need to download separately and build:

                default path               download
wxWidgets       \wxwidgets-2.9.2-mgw       http://www.wxwidgets.org/downloads/
OpenSSL         \openssl-1.0.0d-mgw        http://www.openssl.org/source/
Berkeley DB     \db-4.8.30.NC-mgw          http://www.oracle.com/technology/software/products/berkeley-db/index.html
Boost           \boost-1.47.0-mgw          http://www.boost.org/users/download/
miniupnpc       \miniupnpc-1.6-mgw         http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/

Their licenses:
wxWidgets      LGPL 2.1 with very liberal exceptions
OpenSSL        Old BSD license with the problematic advertising requirement
Berkeley DB    New BSD license with additional requirement that linked software must be free open source
Boost          MIT-like license
miniupnpc      New (3-clause) BSD license

Versions used in this release:
wxWidgets    2.9.2
OpenSSL      1.0.0d
Berkeley DB  4.8.30.NC
Boost        1.47.0
miniupnpc    1.6


Notes
-----
The UI layout is edited with wxFormBuilder.  The project file is
uiproject.fbp.  It generates uibase.cpp and uibase.h, which define base
classes that do the rote work of constructing all the UI elements.

wxWidgets
---------
DOS shell:
cd \wxWidgets-2.9.2-mgw\build\msw
mingw32-make -f makefile.gcc

OpenSSL
-------
MSYS shell:
un-tar sources with MSYS 'tar xfz' to avoid issue with symlinks (OpenSSL ticket 2377)
change 'MAKE' env. variable from 'C:\MinGW32\bin\mingw32-make.exe' to '/c/MinGW32/bin/mingw32-make.exe'

cd /c/openssl-1.0.0d-mgw
./config
make

Berkeley DB
-----------
MSYS shell:
cd /c/db-4.8.30.NC-mgw/build_unix
sh ../dist/configure --enable-mingw --enable-cxx
make

Boost
-----
DOS prompt:
downloaded boost jam 3.1.18
cd \boost-1.47.0-mgw
bjam toolset=gcc --build-type=complete stage

MiniUPnPc
---------
UPnP support is optional, make with USE_UPNP= to disable it.

MSYS shell:
cd /c/miniupnpc-1.6-mgw
make -f Makefile.mingw
mkdir miniupnpc
cp *.h miniupnpc/

Bitcoin
-------
DOS prompt:
cd \bitcoin\src
mingw32-make bitcoin.exe bitcoind.exe -f makefile.mingw
strip bitcoin.exe
strip bitcoind.exe
