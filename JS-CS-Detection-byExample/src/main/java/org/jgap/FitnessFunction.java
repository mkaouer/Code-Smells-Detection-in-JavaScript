/**
 * Fitness functions are used to determine how optimal a particular solution
 * is relative to other solutions. This abstract class should be extended and
 * the evaluate() method implemented. The fitness function is given a Chromosome
 * to evaluate and should return a positive double that reflects its fitness
 * value. The higher the value, the more fit the Chromosome. The actual range
 * of fitness values isn't important (other than the fact that they must be
 * positive doubles): it's the relative difference as a percentage that
 * tends to determine the success or failure of a Chromosome. So in other words,
 * two Chromosomes with respective fitness values of 1 and 100 have the same
 * relative fitness to each other as two Chromosomes with respective fitness
 * values of 10 and 1000 (in each case, the first is 1% as fit as the second).
 * <p>
 * Note: Two Chromosomes with equivalent sets of genes should always be
 * assigned the same fitness value by any implementation of this interface.
