/**
 * Takes away the fitness offset of the population to evolve.
 * The fitness function values of the population of {@link org.jgap.IChromosome}
 * instances will start from a minimum of 1 afterwards.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The removal of an offset in the fitness values of a population strengthens
 * the "survival of the fittest" effect of a selector that performs selection
 * upon fitness values. A high offset in the fitness values of a population
 * lowers the relative difference between the fitness values of the Chromosomes
 * in a population.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Example of applicability</h3>
 * <p>
 * You are optimizing a black box with <i>n</i> parameters that are mapped
 * to {@link org.jgap.IChromosome} instances each having <i>n</i>
 * {@link org.jgap.Gene} instances.<br>
 * You want to minimize the answer time of the black box and provide
 * a {@link org.jgap.FitnessFunction#evaluate(org.jgap.IChromosome)}
 * that takes the genes out of the chromosome, put's it's
 * {@link org.jgap.Gene#getAllele()}
 * values to the parameters and measures the answer time of the black box
 * (by invoking it's service to optimize). <br>
 * The longer the time takes, the worse it's fitness is, so you have to
 * invert the measured times to fitness values:

 * If any {@link org.jgap.NaturalSelector} performs selection based upon the
 * fitness values, it will have to put those values in relation to each other.
 * As a fact, the probability to select the Chromosome that contained the black
 * box parameters that caused an answer time of 4000 ms is "equal" to the
 * probability to select the Chromosome that caused a black box answer time to
 * be 2000 ms!
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Of course one could work around that problem by replacing the
 * <tt>Integer.MAX_VALUE</tt> transformation by a fixed maximum value the black
 * box would need for the service.
 * But what, if you have no guaranteed maximum answer time for the service of
 * the black box ?
 * Even if you have got one, it will be chosen sufficently high above the
 * average answer time thus letting your fitness function return values with a
 * high offset in the fitness.

   * <p>
   * Using this instance to remove the fitness offset in the
   * populations brings the advantage of getting a selection
   * more sensitive to the differences of fitness of the chromosomes.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * The disadvantage is, that the fitness values are modified.
   * The modification is good for jgap's selection method but
   * bad for the guys that want to see the success of your
   * work, or need a proof that a GA improves over time:
   * <br>
   * The value of {@link org.jgap.Genotype#getFittestChromosome()}
   * does not seem to increase over the generations. Most often
   * it becomes worse. This is caused by the fact, that all
   * Chromosomes are getting better over time
   * (the fitness interval of all Chromosomes gets narrower) and
   * the offset that may be cut becomes bigger.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * If you want to get an absolute value independant from the
   * offset that is cut off from the chromosome's fitness value,
   * this method has to be used.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Stop reading here because a
   * </p>
   * <h4>Mathematical Proof</h4>
   * <p>
   * is following.
   * How can it work to get the absolute value for all
   * Chromosomes fitness values? Some Chromosomes may have lived
   * for many generations and everytime their fitness was
   * evaluated here, the old offset was added and a new one was
   * calculated and subtracted from the fitness value.
   * </p>
   * <p>
   * Each bulk fitness evaluation a Chromosome experiences,
   * it's fitness value <i>F</i> get's an addition of the old offset
   * <i>O<sub>(n-1)</sub></i>
   * and a substraction by the new offset <i>O<sub>n</sub></i>.<br>
   * <i><sub>n</sub></i> is the generation index.
   *
   * <pre>
   * F<sub>1</sub> = F<sub>0</sub> + O<sub>0</sub> - O<sub>1</sub>
   * F<sub>2</sub> = F<sub>1</sub> + O<sub>1</sub> - O<sub>2</sub>
   * F<sub>3</sub> = F<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> - O<sub>3</sub>
   *
   * =>
   *
   * 1) F<sub>n</sub> = <b>F<sub>(n-1)</sub></b>
   * + O<sub>(n-1)</sub> - O<sub>n</sub>
   *
   * 2) <b>F<sub>(n-1)</sub></b> = F<sub>(n-2)</sub>
   * + O<sub>(n-2)</sub> - O<sub>(n-1)</sub>

   * 2 in 1)
   *    F<sub>n</sub> = (F<sub>(n-2)</sub> + O<sub>(n-2)</sub>
   * - O<sub>(n-1)</sub>) + O<sub>(n-1)</sub> - O<sub>n</sub>
   *    F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>(n-2)</sub> + O<sub>(n-2)</sub> - O<sub>n</sub>
   *
   * We made a step over 2 generations: With the current offset and the
   * fitness & offset of the
   * "preprevious" generation we can calculate the current fitness.
   * We can assume that this generation stepping works for farer steps
   * <sub>m</sub> (just continue step 2) until you have a generation step value
   * high enough ;-))
   *
   * => F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>(n-m)</sub> + O<sub>(n-m)</sub> - O<sub>n</sub>
   *
   * We want to get the original absolute value of fitness:
   *
   * 3) m := n
   *
   * => F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>0</sub> + O<sub>0</sub> - O<sub>n</sub>
   *
   * solved to F<sub>0</sub> our original value:
   *
   * F<sub>0</sub> = F<sub>n</sub> + O<sub>n</sub> - O<sub>0</sub>
   *
   * And our initial offset {@link #m_previousOffset O<sub>0</sub>} is zero!
