/**
 * A simple, generic pool class that can be used to pool any kind of object.
 * Objects can be released to this pool, either individually or as a
 * Collection, and then later acquired again. It is not necessary for an
 * object to have been originally acquired from the pool in order for it to
 * be released to the pool. If there are no objects present in the pool,
 * an attempt to acquire one will return null. The number of objects
 * available in the pool can be determined with the size() method. Finally,
 * it should be noted that the pool does not attempt to perform any kind
 * of cleanup or re-initialization on the objects to restore them to some
 * clean state when they are released to the pool; it's up to the user to
 * reset any necessary state in the object prior to the release call (or
 * just after the acquire call).
