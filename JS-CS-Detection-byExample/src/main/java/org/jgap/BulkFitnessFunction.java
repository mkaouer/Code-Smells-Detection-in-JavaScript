 * Bulk fitness functions are used to determine how optimal a group of

 * useful (vs. normal fitness functions) when fitness of a particular
 * solution cannot be easily computed in isolation, but instead is
 * dependent upon the fitness of its fellow solutions that are also
 * under consideration. This abstract class should be extended and the
 * evaluateChromosomes() method implemented to evaluate each of the
 * Chromosomes given in an array and set their fitness values prior
 * to returning.
