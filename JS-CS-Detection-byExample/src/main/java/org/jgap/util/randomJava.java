/**
    Implementation of a <b>randomX</b>-compliant class based upon the
    built-in <tt>Java.util.Random</tt> generator.  Note that since the higher
    level result composition methods are different from those in the
    (undocumented) standard library, <b>randomJava</b> results will differ
    from those of the standard library for a given seed.
