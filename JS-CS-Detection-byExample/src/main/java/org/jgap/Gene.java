 * convenience for many applications. Note that it's very important that
 * implementations of this interface also implement the equals() method.
 * Without a proper implementation of equals(), some genetic operations will
 * fail to work properly.

 * When implementing a new Gene type, extend it from {@link org.jgap.BaseGene}!
