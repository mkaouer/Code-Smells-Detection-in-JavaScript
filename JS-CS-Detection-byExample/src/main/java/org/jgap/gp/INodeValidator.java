/**
 * A node validator checks whether a certain node is valid for a given
 * evolution. See ProgramChromosome.growOrFullNode(..).<p>
 * Purpose of this validator: If you have an idea of how the shape of your
 * evolved program must look like regarding some spots (like the first node
 * in the first chromosome to be evolved) then you can constrain your
 * imaginations with this validator. But take care that constraining too much
 * ( e.g., while not considering your available functions) may lead to an
 * endless loop. The endless loop can be avoided by stopping after a number
 * of tries (see method validate, parameter a_tries).
