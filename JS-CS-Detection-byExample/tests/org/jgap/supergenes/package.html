  Provides methods for testing the Supergene. To test this method,
  we use the following task: given amount in pennies [1..99], express it in
  pennies, nickels (5 pennies), dimes (10 pennies) and quarters (25 pennies),
  additionally ensuring that numbers of pennies and nickels are <i>both</i>
  even or both odd. The Supergene, used in <code>SupergeneTest</code>, encloses pennies and nickels and is valid
  if this condition is satisfied. The alternative algorithm (<code>withoutSupergeneTest</code>) does
  exactly the same task without using supergenes.
